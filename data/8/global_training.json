    "context": "",
    "response": "Fetal hemoglobin, or foetal haemoglobin,  is the main oxygen transport protein in the human fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.\nUnusually high levels of fetal haemoglobin production can ameliorate sickle cell disease and β thalassaemia. Although efforts directed at the pharmacological stimulation of fetal haemoglobin as an approach to managing these conditions have met with limited success, there is wide variation in individual responses. \nBased on results, adults humans could be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin.",

Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.",

The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.  T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).  Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone.\nThe activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3. Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRα1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria.

This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma.

The b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs.  Elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.  When compared, the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters were found to have several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. This suggests that the regulation of Hox genes is highly conserved across chordates, consistent with the similar Hox expression patterns in vertebrates and amphioxus.",

It was initially considered that macroautophagy was a bulk process; however, recent findings illustrate that specific cargos (ranging from misfolded or excess proteins, to organelles or even bacterial cells) can be selectively targeted to the pre-autophagosome membrane (i.e. the phagophore) and finally to the vacuoles/lysosomes for their degradation.",

    "response": "Hi, as you mentioned with your difficulty in breathing with is increasing as days are passing. So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. ",

Leukemias are characterized by very high WBC levels (over 50,000/ cubic mm). However, the WBC count can be lower in case of leukemia. They are called sub-leukemic leukemia. In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count.

Brother in law says put a shunt into portal vien and hepatologist says it would kill me. I am 46 year old male and currently have cirrhosis from years of drinking too much alcohol. I have been clean for 90 days and will remain that way. Not proud of of current situation, but, it is what it is.

The suggestion given by your hepatologist is the right one. Whatever your brother-in-law has suggested is only supportive care to prevent complications of cirrhosis. But unfortunately some of these options like shunt itself would lead to many other complications. Yes fractionated bilirubin not needed. I hope that answers your query. Regards.",

She will have mild breathing difficulty which is a normal disease natural history. Necessary medicine she is already taking. Pent ids is an oral penicillin which will prevent further damage to valve & has to be taken life long. Palpitations are also very common & these type of patients may developed irregular heart rate called AF which she is also prone to developed as she has a P Mitral in ECG which means enlargement of a chamber of heart (Left Atrium). Pregnancy is not contraindicated & can be proceeded with close monitoring of a cardiologist. But if the pulmonary pressure is higher than the pregnancy will be high risk. We also give beta blocker to such patients. So remember to ask this with your cardiologist on your next visit. Rest don't worry, be in regular follow up with your cardiologist, do echo every 6 months & keep taking the medicines, and she will be fine. Thanks",

Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis.

    "response": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. As she has a cyst formed in the medial posterior aspect of the bone I think it should be a calcium deposition. Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. ",

    "response": "Hi. Thank you for posting your question. Cerebral Palsy is a long term result of any kind of damage to the developing brain. This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest damage to the brain which is commonly found in child Chat Doctor.  These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc. If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy.

Moreover, WBC can be in normal range if the antibiotics are used. Lower right abdominal can be caused by appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound. Sometimes it is more safe to perform appendectomy than wait and persist unsure. If you are a female, transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed as well as pregnancy test. Hope this will help.

    "context": "",
    "response": "Hi, I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist.",

Is there anythng I can do besides this?",
    "context": "",
    "response": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime.

Lately it has been a bad cramping in the middle of my abdomen under my rib cage and it will send me to the bathroom and go and then maybe sweating and maybe back and forth with cramps and sometimes eventually vomitting.  They I break out in chills and the cramping can last for hours.  Sometimes my knees are in my chest because they can be severe.  It seems to be mostly in the middle of the night and has happened at work  once.  It seems to be food related to me...pizzza, steak even a granola bar.  I have had all the test you can have...colonoscopy, endoscopy, abdominal cat scan and all were normal.  I did have a Hidascan and they say it was normal but I did have the same cramping after the injection.  I am scared to eat many things and trying to eat bland.  I have been to two gastro docs, my internist, and a heart doctor to check anything related there and all checked OK,  My internist and cardiologist just thinks it is the gallbladder.  I have been back to the gastro and told him this cant keep going on and he did send me to a surgeon who said that the hida scan cramping is a sign of gallbladder as well as other symmtoms.  He did say he would take it out.  I have talked with the gastro guy and he said that if it inteferes with your lifetstyle and work then have it removed.  I am just wanting to know if this is the right thing and nothing has been missed.  I do not have gall stones that have shown up on any test.  Thanks",

    "response": "Thank you for sharing your complaint, if there is no gall stone in gall bladder then I think no need to remove gall bladder, rather than indicating other cause for surgical removal of gall bladder. If infection is there, complete course of antibiotic will clear infection of gall bladder as well other infection in abdomen if any. For pain relief you can take diclofenac + Chat Doctor. But after studying your case, for pain in abdomen from many months homeopathic treatment may be much helpful to you if you are interested in homeopathy.

    "context": "",
    "response": "Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

    "response": "Hello Mr Raft. Welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. And medical treatment may not help you much. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may continue Maintop solution to scalp as advised, along with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Improvement will not be visible within a week. Since you have been on treatment since a long time, with not much improvement, do consult a dermatologist, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. If medical methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, smoking, get good rest. Hope this guides you.",

So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mid/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mid/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today. ",

Initially exercises are prescribed for pain relief, if it doesn't work then operative procedure / interventional procedure is done.3. Since disc is bulged and causing compression on the theta sac, and nerve compression - you are having numbness and pain.4. I would recommend having a flat bed, and exercises will give relief.5. If necessary your orthopedics specialist may ask for a belt for less mobility of the spinal movements.6. So please try all, if not then there is no option. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health.

However, would first want to get a good history on how quickly these symptoms came on and if there's been any let-up.  Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies).  If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case.  Worry and anxiousness can also trigger these sorts of symptoms especially the tingling and floating sensations you mention.

    "context": "The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to participate in a wide array of cellular functions. A role for some MAPKs (e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Erk1/2) has been documented in response to certain physiological stimuli, such as ischemia, visceral pain and electroconvulsive shock. We recently demonstrated that restraint stress activates the Erk MAPK pathway, but not c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) or p38MAPK, in several rat brain regions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a different stressor, acute forced swim stress, on the phosphorylation (P) state of these MAPKs in the hippocampus, neocortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum. In addition, effects on the phosphorylation state of the upstream activators of the MAPKs, their respective MAPK kinases (MAPKKs; P-MEK1/2, P-MKK4 and P-MKK3/6), were determined. Finally, because the Erk pathway can activate c-AMP response element (CRE) binding (CREB) protein, and swim stress has recently been reported to enhance CREB phosphorylation, changes in P-CREB were also examined. A single 15 min session of forced swimming increased P-Erk2 levels 2-3-fold in the neocortex, prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in the hippocampus or amygdala. P-JNK levels (P-JNK1 and/or P-JNK2/3) were increased in all brain regions about 2-5-fold, whereas P-p38MAPK levels remained essentially unchanged. Surprisingly, levels of the phosphorylated MAPKKs, P-MEK1/2 and P-MKK4 (activators of the Erk and JNK pathways, respectively) were increased in all five brain regions, and much more dramatically (P-MEK1/2, 4.5 to > 100-fold; P-MKK4, 12 to approximately 300-fold). Consistent with the lack of forced swim on phosphorylation of p38MAPK, there appeared to be no change in levels of its activator, P-MKK3/6. P-CREB was increased in all but cortical (prefrontal, neocortex) areas.",
    "response": "Swim stress specifically and markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of the MAPKKs P-MEK1/2 and P-MKK4 in all brain regions tested without apparent alteration in the phosphorylation of P-MKK3/6. Curiously, phosphorylation of their cognate substrates (Erk and JNK) was increased to a much more modest extent, and in some brain regions was not altered. Similarly, there was a region-specific discrepancy between Erk and CREB phosphorylation. Possible explanations for these findings and comparison with the effects of restraint stress will be discussed.",

Pregnant Wistar rats of comparable weights were randomized into three groups. Group A (control) was given a single dose of 1.25 mL/kg body weight of lime while group B and C were given 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg body weight of trona, respectively. There was no significant difference in the body weight gained across all the groups. 250 mg/kg body weight of trona decreased the number of live fetus, while 500 mg/kg body weight produced no live fetus; 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg body weight of trona led to fetal loss rate of 83.33% and 100%, respectively. Trona also reduced the concentrations of serum progesterone and cholesterol, and increased serum oestradiol.",

In this study, we examine the effects of interaction of genetic variants with physical activity on BP in a relatively genetically homogenous cohort of rural Chinese villagers. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to test for associations of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with variants in 24 genes in BP pathways (196 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) among 3,142 Chinese participants divided according to physical activity (active vs. inactive groups). In the physically active group, two SNPs in NR3C2 were significantly associated with lower SBP, and a SNP in SCNN1B was significantly associated with lower SBP and DBP. In the physically inactive group, a SNP in APLNR was associated with lower SBP, a SNP in GNB3 (guanine nucleotide binding protein, β polypeptide 3) was associated with higher SBP and DBP, and a SNP in BDKRB2 (bradykinin receptor B2) was associated with lower DBP. Cumulative effects in carriers of minor alleles of these SNPs showed reductions of SBP and DBP as large as 8 and 5 mm Hg, respectively, in the active individuals compared to inactive individuals carrying the same number of minor alleles.",

    "context": "To investigate the potential tumour suppressor functions of glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7) and examine the interplay between epigenetic and genetic events in regulating its expression in oesophageal adenocarcinomas (OAC). In vitro and in vivo cell models were developed to investigate the biological and molecular functions of GPX7 in OAC. Reconstitution of GPX7 in OAC cell lines, OE33 and FLO-1, significantly suppressed growth as shown by the growth curve, colony formation and EdU proliferation assays. Meanwhile, GPX7-expressing cells displayed significant impairment in G1/S progression and an increase in cell senescence. Concordant with the above functions, Western blot analysis displayed higher levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 with a decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (RB), indicating its increased tumour suppressor activities. On the contrary, knockdown of GPX7 in HET1A cells (an immortalised normal oesophageal cell line) rendered the cells growth advantage as indicated with a higher EdU rate, lower levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 and an increase in phosphorylated RB. We confirmed the tumour suppressor function in vivo using GPX7-expressing OE33 cells in a mouse xenograft model. Pyrosequencing of the GPX7 promoter region (-162 to +138) demonstrated location-specific hypermethylation between +13 and +64 in OAC (69%, 54/78). This was significantly associated with the downregulation of GPX7 (p<0.01). Neither mutations in the coding exons of GPX7 nor DNA copy number losses were frequently present in the OAC examined (<5%).",

    "context": "Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) via subcutaneous osmotic pumps into mice promotes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). These AngII-induced AAAs develop via a complex process in which there is a transmedial break, lumen dilation, thrombus formation, inflammation involving cells of both the innate and acquired immune systems, and remodeling. The recent development of a high-frequency ultrasound machine has permitted the noninvasive detection of murine abdominal aortas. We assessed the ability of a Visualsonics Vevo 660 high-resolution imaging system to detect AAAs and sequentially quantify the aortic luminal diameter. This system had 100% accuracy in detecting AngII-induced AAAs in vivo, with intrauser and interuser variation coefficients of less than 10% for quantification of the aortic lumen diameter. Male apolipoprotein E (apoE)(-/-) mice were infused subcutaneously with either saline or AngII and were monitored with this ultrasonic system to define the temporal changes in aortic lumen diameter. Aortic luminal diameters were measured in the aneurysm-susceptible region of the suprarenal aorta. For internal controls, abdominal aortic diameters were measured at the level of the left renal branch, because this landmark region did not dilate during AngII infusion. Luminal diameters of the suprarenal aorta did not change significantly in saline-infused mice over 28 days of measurement (P = .71). In contrast, AngII infusion led to rapid dilation of suprarenal aortas during the initial 7 days of infusion (0.071 mm/d; P = .0037 for the change in the initial expansion rate). Further luminal diameter expansions occurred for the remaining 21 days of observation at a more modest rate (0.023 mm/d; P = .0001 for continued expansion after day 7). Within the initial 14 days of AngII infusion, some apoE(-/-) mice died as a result of rupture of the aorta in the suprarenal region. We had previously assumed that aortic dilation and rupture occurred simultaneously. However, in the AngII-infused mice that succumbed to aortic rupture, luminal diameters increased several days before death.",

A better understanding of the type of immune response causing graft-versus-host disease in defined clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplant settings is required to inform development of methods for monitoring patients and providing them tailored care. Twenty-five patients were recruited presenting with myeloid malignancies and treated with a reduced intensity conditioning transplant regimen with graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprising in vivo lymphocyte depletion with alemtuzumab and cyclosporin. A prospective study was performed of lymphocyte subset reconstitution in peripheral blood in relation to the incidence of graft-versus-host disease. Acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with significantly higher numbers of natural killer cells and donor-derived effector CD4 T cells (CD45RO(+) CD27(-)) early (day 30) after transplantation (p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively). This association was evident before the emergence of clinical pathology in six out of seven patients.

    "context": "The Liu Comorbidity Index uses the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) to quantify comorbidity in chronic dialysis patients, capturing baseline comorbidities from days 91 through 270 after dialysis initiation. The 270 day survival requirement results in sample size reductions and potential survivor bias. An earlier and shorter time-frame for data capture could be beneficial, if sufficiently similar comorbidity information could be ascertained. USRDS data were used in a retrospective observational study of 70,114 Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible persons who initiated chronic dialysis during the years 2000-2005. The Liu index was modified by changing the baseline comorbidity capture period to days 1-90 after dialysis initiation for persons continuously enrolled in Medicare. The scores resulting from the original and the modified comorbidity indices were compared, and the impact on sample size was calculated. The original Liu comorbidity index could be calculated for 75% of the sample, but the remaining 25% did not survive to 270 days. Among 52,937 individuals for whom both scores could be calculated, the mean scores for the original and the modified index were 7.4 ± 4.0 and 6.4 ± 3.6 points, respectively, on a 24-point scale.

We tested this hypothesis using genetically engineered mice with extremely low circulating IGF-I levels. Both IGF-I deficient (ID) and normal (N) mice underwent a uninephrectomy (UNx) and sacrificed 2 or 9days later. Initial body weight (BW) and kidney weight (KW) were significantly reduced in ID vs. N mice, while KW/BW ratios were similar. KW increased post-UNx to a comparable extent in ID and N mice (125±4 and 118±6% of pre-UNx KW, p<0.05 vs. C). Kidney IGF-I mRNA levels were similar in the ID and N mice and did not change post-UNx. Kidney IGF-I peptide levels pre-UNx were significantly lower in ID vs. N mice (25±5 vs. 305±39ng/g) and increased in both groups after UNx, remaining low in ID mice (45±4 in ID vs 561±64ng/g in N).

The authors previously identified increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in an early human model of tendinopathy and sought to extend these studies to the cellular analysis of tissue. To characterize inflammatory cell subtypes in early human tendinopathy, the authors explored the phenotype and quantification of inflammatory cells in torn and control tendon samples. Controlled laboratory study. Torn supraspinatus tendon and matched intact subscapularis tendon samples were collected from 20 patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Control samples of subscapularis tendon were collected from 10 patients undergoing arthroscopic stabilization surgery. Tendon biopsy samples were evaluated immunohistochemically by quantifying the presence of macrophages (CD68 and CD206), T cells (CD3), mast cells (mast cell tryptase), and vascular endothelium (CD34). Subscapularis tendon samples obtained from patients with a torn supraspinatus tendon exhibited significantly greater macrophage, mast cell, and T-cell expression compared with either torn supraspinatus samples or control subscapularis-derived tissue (P < .01). Inflammatory cell infiltrate correlated inversely (r = .5; P < .01) with rotator cuff tear size, with larger tears correlating with a marked reduction in all cell lineages.

Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4) is a metabolic factor that raises plasma triglyceride levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In non-diabetic individuals, the ANGPTL4 coding variant E40K has been associated with lower plasma triglyceride levels while the T266M variant has been associated with more modest effects on triglyceride metabolism. The objective of this study was to determine whether ANGPTL4 E40K and T266M are associated with triglyceride levels in the setting of obesity and T2D, and whether modification of triglyceride levels by these genetic variants is altered by a lifestyle intervention designed to treat T2D. The association of ANGPTL4 E40K and T266M with fasting triglyceride levels was investigated in 2,601 participants from the Look AHEAD Clinical Trial, all of whom had T2D and were at least overweight. Further, we tested for an interaction between genotype and treatment effects on triglyceride levels. Among non-Hispanic White Look AHEAD participants, ANGPTL4 K40 carriers had mean triglyceride levels of 1.61 ± 0.62 mmol/L, 0.33 mmol/L lower than E40 homozygotes (p = 0.001).

Whole-cell currents were recorded in the cells with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Macroscopic currents and single-channel currents were recorded in giant inside-out patches and normal inside-out patches, respectively. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 9 software. The basal activity of Kir6.1/SUR2B channels was low. The specific KATP channel opener pinacidil (10 μmol/L) could fully activate Kir6.1/SUR2B channels, which was inhibited by the specific KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (10 μmol/L).

    "context": "Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) is a ubiquitous enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which catalyzes co-translational removal of N-terminal methionine from elongating polypeptide chains during protein synthesis. It specifically removes the terminal methionine in all organisms, if the penultimate residue is non-bulky and uncharged. The MetAP action for exclusion of N-terminal methionine is mandatory in 50-70% of nascent proteins. Such an activity is required for proper sub cellular localization, additional processing and eventually for the degradation of proteins. We cloned genes encoding two such metalloproteases (MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and expressed them as histidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Although they have different substrate preferences, for Met-Ala-Ser, we found, MtMetAP1c had significantly high enzyme turnover rate as opposed to MtMetAP1a. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies as well as monitoring of enzyme activity indicated high temperature stability (up to 50 °C) of MtMetAP1a compared to that of the MtMetAP1c. Modelling of MtMetAP1a based on MtMetAP1c crystal structure revealed the distinct spatial arrangements of identical active site amino acid residues and their mutations affected the enzymatic activities of both the proteins. Strikingly, we observed that 40 amino acid long N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c, compared to its other family members, contributes towards the activity and stability of this enzyme, which has never been reported for any methionine aminopeptidase. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that Val-18 and Pro-19 of MtMetAP1c are crucial for its enzymatic activity. Consistent with this observation, molecular dynamic simulation studies of wild-type and these variants strongly suggest their involvement in maintaining active site conformation of MtMetAP1c.",
    "response": "Our findings unequivocally emphasized that N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c contributes towards the functionality of the enzyme presumably by regulating active site residues through \"action-at-a-distance\" mechanism and we for the first time are reporting this unique function of the enzyme.",

We studied the use of a dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine against H. pylori infection in mice. The cellular immune responses to murine bone marrow-derived DCs pulsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-DC) or live H. pylori SS1 (HP-DC) were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The protective immunity against H. pylori SS1 oral challenge was compared between HP-DC or PBS-DC immunized mice. The effect of regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion by anti-CD25 antibody on HP-DC vaccine efficacy was also evaluated. HP-DC induced a Th1-dominant response in vitro. In vivo, HP-DC immunized mice were characterized by a mixed Th1/Th2 peripheral immune response. However, in the stomach, HP-DC immunized mice expressed a higher level of IFN-gamma compared to PBS-DC immunized mice; no difference was found for interleukin-5 expressions in the stomach. A lower bacterial colonization post-H. pylori challenge was observed in HP-DC immunized mice compared to PBS-DC immunized mice with no significant difference in gastritis severity. H. pylori-specific Th1 response and protective immunity were further enhanced in vivo by depletion of Treg with anti-CD25 antibody.",

    "context": "Diabetic glomerulosclerosis is the hardening of the renal glomeruli that can lead to kidney failure. In the early stage of glomerulosclerosis occur renal mesangial expansion and renal filtration dysfunction. Purple corn has been classified as a functional food and is rich in anthocyanins exerting potential disease-preventive activities. The in vitro study using human renal mesangial cells examined that anthocyanin-rich purple corn butanol fraction (PCB) can attenuate high glucose (HG)-promoted mesangial cell proliferation and matrix accumulation. Cells were cultured for 3 days in media containing 33 mM glucose in the presence of 1-20 μg/mL PCB. In the in vivo animal study, db/db mice were treated with 10 mg/kg anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic extracts of purple corn (PCE) for 8 weeks. HG enhanced mesangial production of the fibrosis biomarkers of collagen IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was markedly attenuated by adding PCB. Such mesangial fibrosis entailed interleukin-8 activation via eliciting Tyk2-STAT signaling pathway. PCB dampened HG-promoted mesangial hyperplasia that appeared to be attributed to increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor. The 8-week administration of PCE lowered plasma glucose level of db/db mice and ameliorated severe albuminuria. Moreover, PCE lessened collagen fiber accumulation in kidney glomeruli and CTGF expression via retarding TGF-β signaling. Protein expressions of nephrin and podocin, key proteins for filtration barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall, were repressed by treating mice with PCE.",

Yet, it is still unclear whether CHEK2 1100delC also confers a colorectal cancer risk independent of its breast cancer risk. CHEK2 1100delC was genotyped in the index cases of 369 Dutch colorectal cancer families that had been excluded for familial breast cancer. The cohort included 132 cases with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and FAP-related disease, and 237 cases with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and HNPCC-related disease.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a representative tumor related to EBV infection. The authors investigated the expression of IL-10 in 21 primary NPCs by using an immunohistochemical approach to examine its prognostic significance. IL-10 staining was positive in 12 of 21 primary NPCs (57%). There was no association between IL-10 expression and gender, tumor size, the occurrence of lymph node metastases, clinical stage, or recurrence. However, there was a significant difference in overall survival between the negative expression and positive expression of IL-10 (P = 0.0348). Although 87.5% of the IL-10 negative group survived for 5 years, only 15.6% of IL-10 positive patients survived for that length of time by the Kaplan-Meier method. IL-10 expression was significant as an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival by multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model (odds ratio, 26.64; P = 0.0019).",

Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis induces cardiac hypertrophy independent of blood pressure by increasing protein synthesis in vivo. KCOs attenuate calcium overload and confer cardioprotection against ischemic stress, and thereby prevent myocardial remodeling. Twelve Wistar-Kyoto rat groups underwent 8 weeks of the drug treatment in combination with NO synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inactive isomer D omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(D-NAME), KCOs(nicorandil; 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, or JTV-506; 0.3 mg/kg/day), or a KATP channel blocker glibenclamide. L-NAME was also treated with hydralazine, p70S6K inhibitor (rapamycin) or MAP kinase kinase inhibitor(PD98059). Finally, left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio(LVW/BW) was quantified followed by histological examinations and kinase assay. L-NAME increased blood pressure and LVW/BW compared with the control. KCOs and hydralazine equally cancelled the increase in blood pressure, whereas only KCOs blocked the increase in LVW/BW and myocardial hypertrophy induced by L-NAME. The L-NAME group showed both p70S6K and ERK activation in the myocardium compared with the control(2.3-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively), which was not reversed by hydralazine.

Male rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet (control group) and a 1% cholesterol diet supplemented by 2.25% L-arginine HCl in drinking water (arginine group). Each group underwent reversed autologous vein bypass grafting of the left common carotid artery using the left external jugular vein. At 2 or 4 weeks after operation, intimal cell proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and intimal thickness of the graft was measured with an ocular cytometer. At 4 weeks after operation, endothelium-dependent responses were examined by isometric tension recording. At 4 weeks after operation, the level of plasma arginine and citrulline are significantly higher in the arginine group (n = 7), compared with the control (n = 7). Intimal thickness in the arginine group (n = 7) was significantly reduced, compared with that of the control (n = 7). At 2 weeks after operation, the BrdU labeling index of the control (n = 5) was significantly higher than that of the arginine group (n = 5).

Some of the functions of Id4 appear to be unique as compared to its other family members Id1, Id2 and Id3. Loss of Id4 gene expression in many cancers in association with promoter hypermethylation has led to the proposal that Id4 may act as a tumor suppressor. In this study we provide functional evidence that Id4 indeed acts as a tumor suppressor and is part of a cancer associated epigenetic re-programming. Data mining was used to demonstrate Id4 expression in prostate cancer. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis was performed to understand molecular mechanisms associated with Id4 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 cells was determined by cell cycle analysis (3H thymidine incorporation and FACS), expression of androgen receptor, p53 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 by a combination of RT-PCR, real time-PCR, western blot and immuno-cytochemical analysis. Id4 expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer. Id4 expression was also down-regulated in prostate cancer line DU145 due to promoter hyper-methylation. Ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 prostate cancer cell line led to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation due in part by an S-phase arrest. In addition to S-phase arrest, ectopic Id4 expression in PC3 cells also resulted in prolonged G2/M phase. At the molecular level these changes were associated with increased androgen receptor (AR), p21, p27 and p53 expression in DU145 cells.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visits to private gynaecologists correlate with better health outcomes and worse participation in organised screening for cancer programs. This is an ecological analysis using municipalities and groups of women at 5-year age intervals within municipalities as study units. First, the Finnish municipalities (n = 452) were classified into three groups by the age-adjusted level of use of private gynaecologists. Secondly, each age group within municipalities was classified into tertiles by the level of private gynaecologist use. The outcomes were participation in cervical and organised breast cancer screening for cancer programmes, stage of gynaecological and breast cancers at diagnosis, and abortion rates and ratios. All data were obtained from national registers by groups at 5-year age intervals and by municipality. Raw and adjusted (age groups, and in some analyses, municipality social class index) odds ratios, total and by urbanity, were calculated. The proportions of women participating in cervical cancer and organised breast cancer screening for cancer were somewhat higher in the groups having a low use of private gynaecologists. The proportions of local cancers of all cervical, uterine, ovarian and breast cancers were similar in the three groups, even though the first analysis method suggested somewhat better results for the low-use group in case of cervical cancer and for the high-use group in case of uterine and breast cancer. The rates of induced abortion were higher in municipalities having a high use of private gynaecologists than in those having lower use.",

Our objectives were to discuss a measure called Positive Orientation towards Early Motherhood (POEM), and investigate its association with self-reported unintended pregnancy experience. We used data from 332 African-American women 13-19 years old recruited at public family planning and prenatal clinics in New Orleans. Using a series of ANOVAs and multinomial logistic regression, we assessed differences in POEM between four different outcome groups: women who were never pregnant and those who had only intended pregnancies, only unintended pregnancies and both unintended and intended pregnancies. The data suggested that young women perceive pregnancy as an opportunity to assert responsibility, become closer with their families and achieve greater intimacy with their boyfriends. Multiple regression analysis indicated that this positive orientation toward early motherhood independently raised the likelihood that young women experienced unintended pregnancies. In particular, the perception that a pregnancy makes a young woman feel more responsible was associated with an increased likelihood that a young woman had only unintended pregnancies compared to no pregnancies at all. Interestingly, this perception did not differentiate young women who had only intended pregnancies from those who were never pregnant.",

In this study, human breast cancer BCap37 cells were transfected with either sense or antisense p53 or p21WAF1/CIP1. The established stable transfectants were then analyzed for an altered sensitivity to paclitaxel, 5-FU or the combinations of these drugs using a series of cytotoxic and apoptosis assays. Tumor cells transfected with antisense p53 or p21WAF1/CIP1 exhibited a significant increase in their sensitivity to paclitaxel.

How these different MTs are formed is unknown, although the number of protofilaments may depend on the nature of the α- and β-tubulins. Here we show that the enzymatic activity of the Caenorhabiditis elegans α-tubulin acetyltransferase (α-TAT) MEC-17 allows the production of 15-p MTs in the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) MTs. Without MEC-17, MTs with between 11 and 15 protofilaments are seen. Loss of this enzymatic activity also changes the number and organization of the TRN MTs and affects TRN axonal morphology. In contrast, enzymatically inactive MEC-17 is sufficient for touch sensitivity and proper process outgrowth without correcting the MT defects. Thus, in addition to demonstrating that MEC-17 is required for MT structure and organization, our results suggest that the large number of 15-p MTs, normally found in the TRNs, is not essential for mechanosensation.",

DMF exhibited high efficiency on cell growth inhibition in PC3 cells with an IC50 value of (9.5 +/- 0.2)micromol/L. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that DMF could induce apoptosis in PC3 cells. A significant decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in PC3 cells treated with DMF, which was in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

The aim of this study was to determine if CK2 was affected by p53. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were subjected to either partial hepatectomy or laparotomy and the levels and subcellular distribution of p53 were studied, following the approach used earlier for CK2. The levels of both proteins were also studied in the human cell lines HL-60 (devoid of p53) and HepG2 (with normal p53 levels) and in fibroblasts from transgenic p53-deficient mice (p53-/-) or homozygous for wild-type p53 (p53+/+). Computer-assisted search was used to detect p53 consensus sequences in genes for CK2 subunits Binding of p53 protein to some of these sequences was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Rat liver p53 protein was present mainly in the fraction extracted from intact nuclei by nucleases (S1) and showed a transient increase at 6 h post partial hepatectomy, as observed previously with nuclear CK2. The human CK2a gene presents the consensus sequence for trans-activation by p53 and specific binding of p53 protein to some of these sequences was detected in vitro.

    "instruction": "Do gene duplications contribute to the overrepresentation of interactions between proteins of a similar age?",
    "context": "The study of biological networks and how they have evolved is fundamental to our understanding of the cell. By investigating how proteins of different ages are connected in the protein interaction network, one can infer how that network has expanded in evolution, without the need for explicit reconstruction of ancestral networks. Studies that implement this approach show that proteins are often connected to proteins of a similar age, suggesting a simultaneous emergence of interacting proteins. There are several theories explaining this phenomenon, but despite the importance of gene duplication in genome evolution, none consider protein family dynamics as a contributing factor. In an S. cerevisiae protein interaction network we investigate to what extent edges that arise from duplication events contribute to the observed tendency to interact with proteins of a similar age. We find that part of this tendency is explained by interactions between paralogs. Age is usually defined on the level of protein families, rather than individual proteins, hence paralogs have the same age. The major contribution however, is from interaction partners that are shared between paralogs. These interactions have most likely been conserved after a duplication event. To investigate to what extent a nearly neutral process of network growth can explain these results, we adjust a well-studied network growth model to incorporate protein families. Our model shows that the number of edges between paralogs can be amplified by subsequent duplication events, thus explaining the overrepresentation of interparalog edges in the data. The fact that interaction partners shared by paralogs are often of the same age as the paralogs does not arise naturally from our model and needs further investigation.",
    "response": "We amend previous theories that explain why proteins of a similar age prefer to interact by demonstrating that this observation can be partially explained by gene duplication events. There is an ongoing debate on whether the protein interaction network is predominantly shaped by duplication and subfunctionalization or whether network rewiring is most important. Our analyses of S. cerevisiae protein interaction networks demonstrate that duplications have influenced at least one property of the protein interaction network: how proteins of different ages are connected.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if gait symmetry is related to age. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were recorded for 172 individuals with stroke and 81 healthy adults walking across a pressure sensitive mat at their preferred speed. Swing time, stance time and step length symmetry ratios were calculated. The relationship of age to velocity and symmetry was examined using Pearson correlations.

In this study, the MT depolymerizing agent colchicine was used to evaluate the contribution of MTs to RNFL birefringence. Retinal nerve fiber bundles of isolated rat retina were observed through an imaging polarimeter set near extinction. Images were taken over an extended period. During baseline, the tissue was perfused with a physiological solution. During a treatment period, the solution was switched either to a control solution identical with the baseline solution or to a similar solution containing colchicine. The contrast of nerve fiber bundles was used to follow change of RNFL birefringence over time. When imaged by the polarimeter, birefringent retinal nerve fiber bundles appeared as either bright or dark stripes. Bundles displayed as bright stripes were used to follow changes in retardance. The contrast of nerve fiber bundles was stable in control experiments. However, in treatment experiments, bundles were bright during the baseline period, but the contrast of bundles decreased rapidly when the colchicine solution was applied; bundles were barely visible after 30 minutes of treatment.

By using live calcium imaging, we compared activation of submucosal neurons by the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin in rectal biopsy specimens collected from 9 patients with IBS (ROME 3 criteria) and 15 healthy subjects. The sensitization of TRPV1 by histamine, its metabolite imidazole acetaldehyde, and supernatants from biopsy specimens was assessed by calcium imaging of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. We then performed a double-blind trial of patients with IBS (mean age, 31 y; range, 18-65 y; 34 female). After a 2-week run-in period, subjects were assigned randomly to groups given either the HRH1 antagonist ebastine (20 mg/day; n = 28) or placebo (n = 27) for 12 weeks. Rectal biopsy specimens were collected, barostat studies were performed, and symptoms were assessed (using the validated gastrointestinal symptom rating scale) before and after the 12-week period. Patients were followed up for an additional 2 weeks. Abdominal pain, symptom relief, and health-related quality of life were assessed on a weekly basis. The primary end point of the study was the effect of ebastine on the symptom score evoked by rectal distension. TRPV1 responses of submucosal neurons from patients with IBS were potentiated compared with those of healthy volunteers. Moreover, TRPV1 responses of submucosal neurons from healthy volunteers could be potentiated by their pre-incubation with histamine; this effect was blocked by the HRH1 antagonist pyrilamine. Supernatants from rectal biopsy specimens from patients with IBS, but not from the healthy volunteers, sensitized TRPV1 in mouse nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons via HRH1; this effect could be reproduced by histamine and imidazole acetaldehyde.

We have previously shown that increased regulatory T cell (T(reg)) fractions in these patients explain T-cell functional deficits. Our murine glioma model recapitulates these findings. Here, we investigate the effects of systemic CTLA-4 blockade in this model. A monoclonal antibody (9H10) to CTLA-4 was employed against well-established glioma.

The specific capacities for anti-CTLA-4 to modify the functions of regulatory versus CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells were evaluated. CTLA-4 blockade confers long-term survival in 80% of treated mice, without eliciting experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Changes to the CD4 compartment were reversed, as anti-CTLA-4 reestablishes normal CD4 counts and abrogates increases in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)GITR(+) regulatory T cell fraction observed in tumor-bearing mice. CD4(+) T-cell proliferative capacity is restored and the cervical lymph node antitumor response is enhanced. Treatment benefits are bestowed exclusively on the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell population and not T(regs), as CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells from treated mice show improved proliferative responses and resistance to T(reg)-mediated suppression, whereas T(regs) from the same mice remain anergic and exhibit no restriction of their suppressive capacity.",

    "context": "We sought to test the hypothesis that the transradial approach is associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to the transfemoral approach, and to examine whether the adoption of the transradial approach could result in improved quality of care for PCI in a single-center practice. Although previous research has suggested that the transradial approach is associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes following PCI, it is not widely used in the United States. We identified 462 transradial and 625 transfemoral PCI cases that were treated at our center between January 2007 and March 2009. The differences between the transradial and transfemoral approaches in risks of in-hospital mortality, bleeding, and vascular complications as well as post-procedural lengths of stay were examined. The risk of bleeding was significantly lower in the transradial group (2.60%) than the transfemoral group (6.08%); the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.68; p = 0.002].

    "context": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. Despite recent success in improving anti-HCV therapy, additional progress is still needed to develop cheaper and interferon (IFN)-free treatments. Here, we report that ferroquine (FQ), an antimalarial ferrocenic analog of chloroquine, is a novel inhibitor of HCV. FQ potently inhibited HCV infection of hepatoma cell lines by affecting an early step of the viral life cycle. The antiviral activity of FQ on HCV entry was confirmed with pseudoparticles expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 from six different genotypes. In addition to its effect on HCV entry, FQ also inhibited HCV RNA replication, albeit at a higher concentration. We also showed that FQ has no effect on viral assembly and virion secretion. Using a binding assay at 4°C, we showed that FQ does not prevent attachment of the virus to the cell surface. Furthermore, virus internalization was not affected by FQ, whereas the fusion process was impaired in the presence of FQ as shown in a cell-cell fusion assay. Finally, virus with resistance to FQ was selected by sequential passage in the presence of the drug, and resistance was shown to be conferred by a single mutation in E1 glycoprotein (S327A). By inhibiting cell-free virus transmission using a neutralizing antibody, we also showed that FQ inhibits HCV cell-to-cell spread between neighboring cells. Combinations of FQ with IFN, or an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease, also resulted in additive to synergistic activity.",

New data, however, suggest that it may be time to revisit this estimate. We estimated total iron bioavailability from the US diet with the use of our recently reported algorithm that estimates nonheme iron absorption and a conservative value for heme iron absorption. We used dietary intake and biomarker information from the NHANES 2001-2002, MyPyramid Equivalents Database, and Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. The survey package in R software was used to estimate means and CIs, taking into account the strata, primary sampling units, and appropriate survey weight. We implemented 2 different approaches to estimate total iron absorption. In the first approach, we included all survey participants but adjusted the geometric mean of nonheme iron absorption to 15 μg ferritin/L serum to mimic values of individuals with no iron stores; in the second approach, absorption was estimated for only nonanemic subjects with no iron stores. A total sample size of 6631 was used based on availability of dietary and iron status biomarker data and C-reactive protein concentration ≤ 6 mg/L. The geometric mean (95% CI) of unadjusted nonheme iron absorption for all subjects was 3.7% (3.6%, 3.8%), higher in female subjects [5.6% (5.4%, 5.7%)] than male subjects [2.6% (2.5%, 2.7%)] (P < 0.0001). Nonheme iron absorption was lower in non-Hispanic whites [3.5% (3.4%, 3.6%)] than Mexican Americans [4.5% (4.2%, 4.8%)] and non-Hispanic blacks [4.4% (4.1%, 4.7%)].

In this study, we investigated the effect of isoquercitrin on lipid accumulation and its molecular mechanisms in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. To investigate the effect of isoquercitrin on lipid accumulation, H4IIE cells were induced by FFA and the total lipid levels were detected by Oil Red O staining. Furthermore, The protein levels of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the gene expressions of transcriptional factor, lipogenic genes, and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) were analyzed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. To further confirm the pathway of isoquercitrin-mediated hepatic lipid metabolism, H4IIE cells were treated with an AMPK inhibitor and AdipoR1 siRNA. Isoquercitrin significantly enhances AMPK phosphorylation, downregulates sterol regulatory element binding protein transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expressions. Pretreatment with AMPK inhibitor, significantly decreased the AMPK phosphorylation and increased FAS expression stimulated by isoquercitrin. Isoquercitrin might also upregulate the expression of AdipoR1 dose-dependently via AMPK in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor and AdipoR1 siRNA.",

In addition, expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1/cip1) is required for resection-induced enterocyte proliferation. This study sought to establish a mechanistic link between EGFR-mediated intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and p21(waf1/cip1) expression. EGF was used to stimulate IEC-6 and HCA-7 cells. P21(waf1/cip1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. P21(waf1/cip1) promoter studies were performed using p21(waf1/cip1) promoter-driven luciferase assay. Pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) were used to block these pathways downstream of the activated EGFR. Constitutively active Ras, Raf, or MEK-1 constructs were transfected into cells for overexpression studies. Cell proliferation was measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation following p21(waf1/cip1) silencing with RNAi. Finally, Cyclin D(1)/Cdk interaction was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. EGFR activation in intestinal epithelial cells induced the expression of p21(waf1/cip1) mRNA and protein This event was transcriptionally regulated via a 50-bp segment of the p21(waf1/cip1) promoter as a result of MAPK activation. Exogenous EGF failed to induce proliferation in p21(waf1/cip1)-silenced cells and adaptive proliferation after intestinal resection in p21(waf1/cip1)-null mice.

Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in controls, Marsh 3A-B, and Marsh 3C patients by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Target gene expression was assessed by qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, and the effect of gliadin was evaluated by in vitro stimulation experiments on duodenal biopsies. Seven miRNAs were identified as significantly downregulated in the duodenum of adult CD patients as compared with controls. qPCR validated the decreased expression of miR-192-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-338-3p, and miR-197, in particular in patients with more severe histological lesions (Marsh 3C). In silico analysis of possible miRNA targets identified several genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity.

However, resistance to erlotinib is a major clinical problem. Earlier we have demonstrated the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cells, leading to increased proliferation and invasion. Here, we investigated the role of Hh signaling in erlotinib resistance of TGF-β1-induced NSCLC cells that are reminiscent of EMT cells. Hh signaling was inhibited by specific siRNA and by GDC-0449, a small molecule antagonist of G protein coupled receptor smoothened in the Hh pathway. Not all NSCLC patients are likely to benefit from EGFR-TKIs and, therefore, cisplatin was used to further demonstrate a role of inhibition of Hh signaling in sensitization of resistant EMT cells. Specific pre- and anti-miRNA preparations were used to study the mechanistic involvement of miRNAs in drug resistance mechanism. siRNA-mediated inhibition as well as pharmacological inhibition of Hh signaling abrogated resistance of NSCLC cells to erlotinib and cisplatin. It also resulted in re-sensitization of TGF-β1-induced A549 (A549M) cells as well the mesenchymal phenotypic H1299 cells to erlotinib and cisplatin treatment with concomitant up-regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (Sox2, Nanog and EpCAM) and down-regulation of miR-200 and let-7 family miRNAs. Ectopic up-regulation of miRNAs, especially miR-200b and let-7c, significantly diminished the erlotinib resistance of A549M cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling by GDC-0449 in EMT cells resulted in the attenuation of CSC markers and up-regulation of miR-200b and let-7c, leading to sensitization of EMT cells to drug treatment, thus, confirming a connection between Hh signaling, miRNAs and drug resistance.",

Aberrant methylation in CDH13 and MGMT was associated with clinicopathologic features of NSCLC. Hypermethylation detected in primary tumors was not observed in corresponding blood samples, which rendered this an unsuitable blood-based test for NSCLC detection. Systemic methylation changes may be a diagnostic marker for tumor development or prognosis. Here, we investigate the relationship between gene methylation in lung tumors relative to normal lung tissue and whether DNA methylation changes can be detected in paired blood samples. Sixty-five patients were enrolled in a surgical case series of non-small-cell lung carcinoma at a single institution. By using bisulfite pyrosequencing, CpG methylation was quantified at 5 genes (RASSF1A, CDH13, MGMT, ESR1, and DAPK) in lung tumor, pathologically normal lung tissue, and circulating blood from enrolled cases. The analyses of methylation in tumors compared with normal lung tissue identified higher methylation of CDH13, RASSF1A, and DAPK genes, whereas ESR1 and MGMT methylation did not differ significantly between these tissue types. We then examined whether the 3 aberrantly methylated genes could be detected in blood. The difference in methylation observed in tumors was not reflected in methylation status of matching blood samples, which indicated a low feasibility of detecting lung cancer by analyzing these genes in a blood-based test.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that intermittent dosing would allow for dose escalation and greater inhibition of EGFR-dependent antiapoptotic pathways. To test these assertions, we compared combinations of paclitaxel and gefitinib using either intermittent or continuous dosing schedules in mice. We found that when used in combination with paclitaxel, pulsatile gefitinib was significantly superior to continuous dosing. When gefitinib was administered for one or two consecutive days before paclitaxel, much higher doses could be given safely. Two days of gefitinib treatment before paclitaxel was most effective, causing significantly greater mean tumor regression and a higher percentage of complete responses than other schedules.",

    "context": "Dysregulated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in several human malignancies. Hh signaling inhibitors are predicted to have a minimal effect when the Smoothened receptor is mutated. Implications that Gli proteins are molecular targets of arsenic trioxide (ATO) action prompted us to investigate the expression of Hh signaling in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the influence of ATO on the Hh signaling pathway in APL. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were employed to analyze the expression of Hh pathway components and the influence of ATO on the Hh signaling pathway in APL. The expression of Hh pathway components was significantly upregulated in APL. In newly diagnosed APL patients, Gli2 expression was significantly positively correlated with Gli1 (R = 0.57, p < 0.001) and Smo (R = 0.56, p < 0.001) and the expression of Hh pathway components was significantly higher in the high WBC group (p < 0.05). ATO can significantly downregulate the expression of Hh pathway components in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05).",
    "response": "The Hh pathway is aberrantly activated in APL and associated with a bad prognostic factor. ATO can effectively inhibit the expression of the Hh pathway.

    "context": "Neuraxial anaesthesia improves tissue perfusion and tissue oxygen tension. Vasodilation induced by this technique may result in hypotension requiring the administration of vasoactive drugs. The use of peripheral vasoconstrictors might counteract the improved tissue perfusion and its potentially beneficial effects. We therefore investigated the effect of i.v. norepinephrine and ephedrine on skin perfusion using laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in patients during spinal anaesthesia. Skin blood flow expressed in perfusion units (PU) provided by LDF was measured simultaneously at the foot and the manubrium levels in 44 patients during spinal anaesthesia with a sensory level below T5. Norepinephrine infusion was then titrated to normalize mean arterial pressure (MAP) in 23 patients (Group NOR). Ephedrine (max. 10 mg) was administered in 21 patients (Group EPH). Changes in relative PU were compared between the two sites of measurements in each group during drug administration. The same doses of norepinephrine were assessed in 11 normal volunteers to assure comparable vasoreactivity at the foot and manubrium levels. Spinal anaesthesia resulted in a 10% decrease in MAP (P<0.001), an increase in relative PU values at the foot level (P<0.001), and a decrease at the sternum level (P<0.05). Norepinephrine and ephedrine produced a significant increase in relative PU values at the foot level when compared with the sternum level (NOR: P=0.02; EPH: P=0.0035).

Although NF-κB in tumors may contribute to aggressive characteristic features via transcription of angiogenesis and invasion-related factors, there is no definitive evidence showing a correlation between quantitated NF-κB activity and prognosis. In this study, we quantitated NF-κB activity of various human pancreatic cancer cell lines and evaluated whether NF-κB activity was related to tumor progression and prognosis for pancreatic cancer in mice. We quantitated NF-κB activity in six pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-2, MIAPaCa-2, Panc-1 and PL45) and evaluated downstream target genes of NF-κB such as VEGF, IL-8 and MMP-9 in vitro. Next, we evaluated tumor progression and prognosis using subcutaneous tumor model in vivo between cell lines with the highest and lowest NF-κB activity. BxPC-3 had the highest and AsPC-1 had the lowest NF-κB activity in the 6 cell lines. Expression of VEGF, IL-8 and MMP-9 in BxPC-3 was significantly higher than those in AsPC-1 cells in vitro (p < 0.001) and tumor growth in BxPC-3 was faster than that in AsPC-1 group (p < 0.001) resulting in worse survival in vivo (p = 0.0339).",

A total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n = 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size. At a median follow-up of 54 months, 51 disease relapses (26.7%) and 21 deaths (11%) were observed.

Specifically, many animal models rely on reflexive measures of hypersensitivity and ignore, or cannot assess, spontaneous pain, the hallmark characteristic of central pain in humans. Here, we adopt a conditioned place preference paradigm to test if animals with lesions in the anterolateral quadrant of the spinal cord develop signs consistent with spontaneous pain. This paradigm relies on the fact that pain relief is rewarding to animals, and has been used previously to show that animals with peripheral nerve injury develop tonic pain. With the use of 2 analgesic treatments commonly used to treat patients with central pain (clonidine infusion and motor cortex stimulation), we demonstrate that analgesic treatments are rewarding to animals with spinal cord lesions but not sham-operated controls.

All participants completed an interviewer administered questionnaire and had anthropometric and blood pressure (BP) measurements performed. Fasting blood samples were collected for measurement of glucose, lipids, and hsCRP. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors independently associated with high hsCRP. Analyses included 342 men and 404 women with mean age 18.8 ± 0.6 years. Approximately 15% of the participants had high risk hsCRP (>3 mg/L), with a higher prevalence among women (20 vs. 9%; p < 0.001). The prevalence of elevated hsCRP increased with body mass index category, high waist circumference (WC), high triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein, and lower parental education among women, but only for high WC and lower parental education among men. In logistic regression models controlling for sex and parental education, high WC was associated with significantly higher odds of high hsCRP (OR 7.8, 95% CI 4.8-12.9, p < 0.001).

Early-spring red deadnettle stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisaccharide manninotriose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glcα1,2βFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections, together with phloem sap analyses, strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbohydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in red deadnettle are discussed.",
    "response": "It is demonstrated for the first time that manninotriose is a novel and important player in the RFO metabolism of red dead deadnettle. It is proposed that manninotriose represents a temporary storage carbohydrate in early-spring deadnettle, at the same time perhaps functioning as a membrane protector and/or as an antioxidant in the vicinity of membranes, as recently suggested for other RFOs and fructans. This novel finding urges further research on this peculiar carbohydrate on a broader array of RFO accumulators.",

We determined the genotype and haplotype distribution of the rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms of the GC gene encoding vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and investigated the associations between these gene variants and their haplotypes with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in girls from South Brazil. Cross-sectional study including 198 apparently healthy girls aged 10-18 years. Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Participants were genotyped for rs4588 and rs7041 by real-time PCR, with allelic discrimination assays. Mean chronological age and BMI percentile were 13.17 ± 1.74 years and 57.81 ± 29.03, respectively.

    "instruction": "Does genetic incorporation of the protein transduction domain of Tat into Ad5 fiber enhance gene transfer efficacy?",
    "context": "Human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has been widely explored as a gene delivery vector for a variety of diseases. Many target cells, however, express low levels of Ad5 native receptor, the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), and thus are resistant to Ad5 infection. The Protein Transduction Domain of the HIV Tat protein, namely PTD tat, has been shown to mediate protein transduction in a wide range of cells. We hypothesize that re-targeting Ad5 vector via the PTD tat motif would improve the efficacy of Ad5-mediated gene delivery. In this study, we genetically incorporated the PTD tat motif into the knob domain of Ad5 fiber, and rescued the resultant viral vector, Ad5.PTD tat. Our data showed the modification did not interfere with Ad5 binding to its native receptor CAR, suggesting Ad5 infection via the CAR pathway is retained. In addition, we found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy in all of the cell lines that we have tested, which included both low-CAR and high-CAR decorated cells. Competitive inhibition assays suggested the enhanced infectivity of Ad5.PTD tat was mediated by binding of the positively charged PTD tat peptide to the negatively charged epitopes on the cells' surface. Furthermore, we investigated in vivo gene delivery efficacy of Ad5.PTD tat using subcutaneous tumor models established with U118MG glioma cells, and found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy compared to unmodified Ad5 vector as analyzed by a non-invasive fluorescence imaging technique.",
    "response": "Genetic incorporation of the PTD tat motif into Ad5 fiber allowed Ad5 vectors to infect cells via an alternative PTD tat targeting motif while retaining the native CAR-mediated infection pathway. The enhanced infectivity was demonstrated in both cultured cells and in in vivo tumor models. Taken together, our study identifies a novel tropism expanded Ad5 vector that may be useful for clinical gene therapy applications.",

Nevertheless, the maturation inducing effect of tumor lysates on DCs is discussed controversially and the efficacy of tumor vaccines varies significantly. Using three individual adherent colorectal tumor cell lines we also faced the difficulty to obtain consistent results regarding maturation inducing effect of tumor lysates on DCs. Therefore, we compared different methods to prepare tumor cell lysate and could demonstrate that trypsinizing as a method to harvest adherent tumor cells has a significant negative impact on biologic activity of tumor lysates. Specifically, we assessed induction of maturation markers CD40, CD80, and CD86 on DCs which were treated with differently prepared lysates.",

However, there remain few long-term studies investigating key demographic and behavioral factors--and gender differences in particular--that may pose barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART), especially in settings with universal healthcare. We evaluated access and adherence to ART in a long-term cohort of HIV-positive IDU in a setting where medical care and antiretroviral therapy are provided free of charge through a universal healthcare system. We evaluated baseline antiretroviral use and subsequent adherence to ART among a Canadian cohort of HIV-positive IDU. We used generalized estimating equation logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with 95% adherence to antiretroviral therapy estimated based on prescription refill compliance. Between May 1996 and April 2008, 545 IDU participants were followed for a median of 23.8 months (Inter-quartile range: 8.5-91.6), among whom 341 (63%) were male and 204 (37%) were female. Within the six-month period prior to the baseline interview, 133 (39%) men and 62 (30%) women were on ART (p=0.042). After adjusting for clinical characteristics as well as drug use patterns measured longitudinally throughout follow-up, female gender was independently associated with a lower likelihood of being 95% adherent to ART (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.70; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.53-0.93).",

To determine the bioavailability of a nutritional source of TRP obtained from milk protein and to assess whether administration of this material produced neuroendocrine and neuropsychological effects consistent with increased brain serotonin activity. We studied 24 healthy subjects who ingested approximately 1.8 g of nutritionally-sourced TRP or placebo in a double-blind, parallel group, design. We carried out venous sampling for amino acid and hormone estimation and performed a test of emotional processing using a facial expression recognition task. The nutritionally-sourced TRP caused a substantial increase in the availability of TRP in plasma. Relative to placebo the TRP material produced some evidence of an increase in plasma cortisol, and enhanced the perception of fearful and happy facial expressions.",

Previous studies have shown that visceral fat, rather than subcutaneous fat, is a risk factor for metabolic diseases. This study was conducted to determine whether chronic alcohol exposure differentially affects lipid metabolism in visceral (epididymal) and subcutaneous fat, and the mechanisms underlying the alcohol effects. Male Wistar rats were pair-fed the Lieber-DeCarli control or alcohol liquid diet for 12 weeks to determine the effects of alcohol on the white fat. Tissue explants culture and 3T3-L1 culture were conducted to define the role of acetaldehyde in alcohol-induced adipose tissue dysfunction. Chronic alcohol feeding significantly reduced visceral fat mass and down-regulated peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, 2 important transcription factors in regulation of lipogenesis. The protein levels of lipogenic enzymes including phospho-ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, lipin1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in the visceral fat were reduced. In contrast, chronic alcohol exposure did not affect subcutaneous fat mass and had less effect on the protein levels of lipogenic enzymes and regulators. Accordingly, the visceral fat showed a lower protein level of aldehyde detoxification enzymes compared to the subcutaneous fat. Acetaldehyde treatment to either visceral fat explants or 3T3-L1 adipocytes produced similar effects on lipogenic enzymes and regulators as observed in animal model.",

Lysozyme expression was compared between the wild type and the lysozyme M-/- mice using real time quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Muramidase activity and bactericidal activity of lysozyme was measured using a lysoplate radial diffusion assay and a liquid broth assay, respectively. To determine if depletion of lysozyme M increases a susceptibility to pneumococal otitis media, 50 CFU of S. pneumoniae 6B were transtympanically inoculated to the middle ear and viable bacteria were counted at day 3 and 7 with clinical grading of middle ear inflammation. Immunolabeling revealed that localization of lysozyme M and lysozyme P is specific to some/particular cell types of the Eustachian tube. Lysozyme P of lysozyme M-/- mice was mainly expressed in the submucosal gland but not in the tubal epithelium. Although lysozyme M-/- mice showed compensatory up-regulation of lysozyme P, lysozyme M depletion resulted in a decrease in both muramidase and antimicrobial activities.

Apoptosis is critical to the normal clearance of these sequestered PMNs. Conversely, dysfunctional apoptosis prolongs the PMN functional life span, potentially exacerbating PMN-mediated tissue injury and the development of MOF. We hypothesized that severe trauma, in addition to priming PMNs, provokes dysfunctional PMN apoptosis. Neutrophils were harvested daily from 12 severely injured patients at high risk for MOF, cultured for 24 hours, and assessed for apoptosis with use of acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining and fluorescence microscopy. Priming for elastase release was measured in freshly isolated patient PMNs. Plasma from patients was assessed for its ability to delay apoptosis of normal PMNs. Four patients (33%) had MOF. Neutrophil apoptosis was profoundly delayed in severely injured patients throughout the 5-day study period. Priming for elastase release was augmented concomitantly. Patients' plasma delayed apoptosis of normal PMNs.",

Using a tissue slice preparation, we recorded the single-unit activity of POAH neurons from the adult male rat, in response to temperature and CGRP (10 muM). Based on the slope of firing rate as a function of temperature, neurons were classified as either warm sensitive or temperature insensitive. All warm sensitive neurons responded to CGRP with a significant decrease in firing rate. While CGRP did not alter the firing rates of some temperature insensitive neurons, responsive neurons showed an increase in firing rate.",

The objective of these experiments was to examine the role of mu-opioid and nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms in the PPTg in cocaine self-administration. Microinfusions of mu-opioid and nicotinic receptor selective compounds were made into the PPTg of rats trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously, in the vicinity of cholinergic cells which are known to project to the midbrain dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The mu-opioid selective agonist DAMGO, tested at doses of 0, 0.05 and 0.5 microg, produced a dose-related reduction in the number of cocaine infusions obtained during the 1-h self-administration sessions. The mu-selective antagonist CTOP (0-2 microg) and nicotine (0-10 microg) did not produce significant changes in cocaine self-administration.

Since endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been described to serve as a biomarker for the CV risk and are known to be depleted in various diseases, we were interested if SLE would also be associated with altered peripheral EPC levels or functional abnormalities of these cells. EPCs were quantified in 31 female SLE patients with different disease activity and in age-matched healthy controls (HCs) by FACS analysis and by colony forming unit (CFU) assay. Furthermore, EPC adhesion and migration capacity were tested. EPC levels were similar in HC and SLE when assessed by FACS (0.045 +/- 0.006% vs 0.036 +/- 0.007% within the lymphocyte gate) and by the CFU assay (18 +/- 3 vs 15 +/- 2 colonies/well). No correlation with disease activity could be observed, but SLE patients treated with chloroquine exhibited significantly decreased EPC levels (0.058 +/- 0.005% without vs 0.024 +/- 0.008% with chloroquine, P < 0.05). Addition of chloroquine to in vitro cultures also led to a decreased colony formation in SLE and in HC. When testing the adhesion and migration capacity of EPC on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cells from SLE patients had reduced adhesion (19.2 +/- 3.5% vs 36.6 +/- 5.2% EPC/high power field, P < 0.02) and migratory activity (56 +/- 6 cells/random microscopic field in SLE vs 121 +/- 28 in controls, P < 0.02).",

JCV and EBV DNA were assessed by PCR, and FISH technique was used to localize viral infection and to estimate chromosomal instability (rogue cells, 'chromosomal aberrations') throughout evolution. The influence of viral infection and chromosomal instability on freedom from progression (FFP) was investigated in HL patients. PCR product sequencing of PBL identified JCV in 42 (57%) circulating lymphocytes of HL patients. FISH analysis revealed that the presence of cells with a high JCV genome copy number--associated to the presence of rogue cells and 'higher frequency of chromosomal aberrations'--increased from 15% before treatment to 52% (P < 10(-5)) after. The co-activation of JCV and EBV was independent of known prognostic parameters and associated with a shorter FFP (JCV and EBV co-activation P < 0.001, rogue cells P < 0.002).",

HSCT grafts from unrelated donors are commonly collected at distant sites. Therefore, graft storage and transportation becomes crucial in the HSCT process. We aimed to study the impact of graft quality on clinical outcome and identify factors affecting graft quality. We investigated the influence of graft quality on the clinical outcome in 144 HSCT patients. Graft quality was assessed by determining the viability (7-aminoactinomycin D [7AAD]) on a frozen-thawed sample from the peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. Patients receiving PBSCs with inferior quality (i.e., viability < 64% in the frozen-thawed sample) more frequently developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) Grades I to IV than patients receiving grafts with better quality (p = 0.025). The transplant-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the group receiving grafts with lower viability (p = 0.03). The viability of the frozen-thawed samples was highly variable (median, 64%; range, 24%-96%). No correlation could be observed when comparing the viability in newly arrived PBSC grafts to frozen-thawed vials. Grafts with white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 300 × 10(9) /L had lower viability than those with lower WBC counts (p < 0.001).",

It is speculated that disseminated cancer cells may adhere to such damaged peritoneum and metastasize. We hypothesized that insufflation using humidified-warm CO2, which has been shown to reduce mesothelial damage, will also ameliorate peritoneal inflammation and tumor cell implantation compared to conventional dry-cold CO2. Laparoscopic insufflation was modeled in mice along with anesthesia and ventilation. Entry and exit ports were introduced to maintain insufflation using dry-cold or humidified-warm CO2 with a constant flow and pressure for 1 h; then 1000 or 1 million fluorescent-tagged murine colorectal cancer cells (CT26) were delivered into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneum was collected at intervals up to 10 days after the procedure to measure inflammation, mesothelial damage, and tumor burden using fluorescent detection, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy. Rapid temperature control was achieved only in the humidified-warm group. Port-site tumors were present in all mice. At 10 days, significantly fewer tumors on the peritoneum were counted in mice insufflated with humidified-warm compared to dry-cold CO2 (p < 0.03). The inflammatory marker COX-2 was significantly increased in the dry-cold compared to the humidified-warm cohort (p < 0.01), while VEGFA expression was suppressed only in the humidified-warm cohort.

Surplus frozen tissue from 27 untreated patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma who underwent preoperative CT imaging was analyzed for gene expression. A team of neuroradiologists blinded to the genomic analysis results reviewed an extensive list of CT findings. The imaging correlated with genomic expression for cyclin D1, angiogenesis-related genes (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and ligands), which relate to enhancement on the basis of other tumor types; and epidermal growth factor receptor, which may relate to proliferation and mass effect. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2 correlated with the enhancement of the primary tumor (P = .018 and P = .025, respectively), whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor correlated with mass effect (P = .03).

Imidazole derivatives such as cimetidine and omeprazole have been shown to markedly interact with carbamazepine, a major anticonvulsant with a narrow therapeutic range. Therefore, the influence of steady-state pantoprazole on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine was investigated. N = 20 healthy volunteers (12 male/8 female) completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. During the test period they received 40 mg pantoprazole p.o. once daily for 11 days and concomitantly a single oral dose of 400 mg carbamazepine on day 5. In the reference period placebo was administered instead of pantoprazole. Serum concentrations of carbamazepine and its active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were measured until day 11. Geometric means of AUC (extent characteristic) and Cmax/AUC (rate characteristic) of carbamazepine were 292 and 287 mgxh/l, and 0.0150 and 0.0144 l/h (reference and test), respectively. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals of the ratios were 0.98 (0.95, 1.01) for AUC, and 0.96 (0.92, 1.00) for Cmax/AUC, respectively. Since the 90% confidence intervals of the primary characteristics, AUC and Cmax/AUC were entirely within the predefined equivalence range of 0.80 - 1.25, lack of interaction of pantoprazole with the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine was demonstrated.

Problems associated with high HIV prevalence are compounded by gender inequality and high rates of gender-based violence exacerbated by heavy alcohol use and increasing methamphetamine use. Informal drinking establishments (known as shebeens) were geocoded and mapped. Based on visual examination, we identified 36 neighbourhoods, each of which contained between three to seven drinking venues clustered together. Neighbourhoods were separated from each other by at least 200m. We randomly selected 30 of the 36 neighbourhoods. Outreach workers screened males in shebeens and screened their female partners. This analysis includes 580 study participants recruited from 30 neighbourhoods between 2010 and 2012. All participants completed a baseline questionnaire that included individual-level, couple-level, and neighbourhood-level measures of alcohol and other drug use, HIV infection, and HIV risk behaviours. Multilevel fixed effects regression analyses stratified by gender were conducted to examine correlates of HIV infection. Women were twice as likely as men to be HIV infected, yet they reported fewer sex partners. Neighbourhood prevalence of HIV was correlated with greater likelihood of HIV infection among women, but not men.

This study analyzed the asymmetry in the levels of effort, net joint moment during gait (walking moment) and maximal potential moment in the plantarflexors, hip flexors and extensors during gait. Twenty post-stroke and 10 healthy individuals were assessed when walking at a comfortable speed on a treadmill. Their efforts were estimated bilaterally with a biomechanical approach (muscular utilization ratio) which is the walking moment relative to the muscle's maximal capability (maximal potential moment). Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between asymmetry in walking moment and maximal potential moment. Healthy individuals presented symmetrical values of effort, walking moment and maximal potential moment for all muscle groups. Post-stroke individuals had asymmetrical walking moment in plantarflexion and hip extension. For the asymmetry in the levels of effort and maximal potential moment, they formed two subgroups; the low-effort subgroup presented symmetrical effort and their asymmetry in walking moment was not related to their asymmetry in maximal potential moment for plantarflexors (R = 0.44; P > 0.05).

Because EETs have antiinflammatory properties, we determined whether or not inhibition of sEH attenuates disease development in the monocrotaline model of pulmonary hypertension in rats. sEH inhibition was achieved using 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (25 mg/l) and cis- 4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (5 mg/l) administered via drinking water starting 3 days prior to monocrotaline injection (60 mg/kg). Monocrotaline induced the development of progressive pulmonary hypertension. sEH inhibition increased the plasma ratio of EETs to DHETs and attenuated the monocrotaline-induced increase in pulmonary artery medial wall thickness as well as the degree of vascular muscularization. Moreover, right ventricular pressure was significantly lower in the group treated with sEH inhibitors. Pulmonary sEH protein expression and sEH activity, as well as pulmonary cytochrome P450 epoxygenase activity were all impaired in monocrotaline-treated rats as compared with control animals. sEH inhibitors, however, increased the plasma ratio of EETs to dihydroxy epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Monocrotaline induced the proliferation of pulmonary endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo as determined by 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-Uridine incorporation, and this effect was significantly blunted in animals treated with sEH inhibitors.

However, a functional dissection that clarifies the contribution of IGF-II-binding receptors in tumor progression and a respective molecular characterization of IGF-II signaling has not been performed. Therefore, expression of IGF-II and its receptors IGF-receptor type I (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (IR) was efficiently blocked using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HCC cells. Despite functional IR-signaling, oncogenic IGF-II effects such as tumor cell viability, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis were solely transmitted by IGF-IR. Although IGF-II signaling was previously not described in the context of HCC cell migration, the IGF-II-dependent expression profile displayed a high percentage of genes involved in cell motility and adhesion. Indeed, IGF-II overexpression promoted HCC cell migration, especially in synergy with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The therapeutic relevance of IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling was tested in vitro and in a murine xenograft transplantation model using the IGF-IR inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP). IGF-IR inhibition by small molecule treatment efficiently reduced IGF-II-dependent signaling and all protumorigenic properties of the IGF-II/IGF-IR pathway.",

The concentration of PS-exposing EVs in platelet-free plasma (PFP) of healthy subjects was measured by FCM using either light scattering or fluorescence as the trigger and fluorescent Annexin-5 (Anx5) as the specific label. In addition, PS-exposing EVs were enumerated by electron microscopy (EM) after labeling with Anx5 gold nanoparticles and sedimentation on EM grids. We show that about 50× more Anx5-positive EVs are detected by FCM when detection is triggered on fluorescence as compared with light scattering. By fluorescence triggering, concentrations of 22 000-30 000 Anx5-positive EVs per μL PFP were determined, using two different flow cytometers.

To determine whether Ang II was sufficient to provoke TNF biosynthesis in the adult heart, we examined the effects of Ang II in isolated buffer-perfused Langendorff feline hearts. Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in myocardial TNF mRNA and protein biosynthesis in the heart as well as in cultured adult cardiac myocytes. The effects of Ang II on myocardial TNF mRNA and protein synthesis were mediated through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), insofar as an AT1R antagonist (AT1a) blocked the effects of Ang II, whereas an angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) antagonist (AT2a) had no effect. Stimulation with Ang II led to the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), two transcription factors that are important for TNF gene expression. Nuclear factor-kappaB activation was accompanied by phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha on serine 32 as well as degradation of IkappaBalpha, suggesting that the effects of Ang II were mediated through an IkappaBalpha-dependent pathway.

The study included 122 participants (69 men and 53 women) who complained of shoulder pain at rest and 122 age-matched and sex-matched controls who did not experience pain at rest. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for both the left and right shoulders and compared using a four-point visual analog scale of subjective shoulder pain. Correlations between SUVs and uric acid and C-reactive proteins were also evaluated. SUVs for shoulder joints with rest and/or motion pain were significantly higher than those for pain-free shoulder joints. SUVs associated with mild and severe pain at rest were significantly higher than those associated with absence of pain at rest, and SUVs associated with moderate and severe pain on motion were significantly higher than those associated with absence of motion pain. Furthermore, SUVs were significantly correlated with uric acid in men (β=0.21, P=0.02) and in all participants (β=0.22, P<0.001).",

    "instruction": "Does tic20 form a channel independent of Tic110 in chloroplasts?",
    "context": "The Tic complex (Translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts) mediates the translocation of nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins across the inner envelope membrane. Tic110 forms one prominent protein translocation channel. Additionally, Tic20, another subunit of the complex, was proposed to form a protein import channel - either together with or independent of Tic110. However, no experimental evidence for Tic20 channel activity has been provided so far. We performed a comprehensive biochemical and electrophysiological study to characterize Tic20 in more detail and to gain a deeper insight into its potential role in protein import into chloroplasts. Firstly, we compared transcript and protein levels of Tic20 and Tic110 in both Pisum sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found the Tic20 protein to be generally less abundant, which was particularly pronounced in Arabidopsis. Secondly, we demonstrated that Tic20 forms a complex larger than 700 kilodalton in the inner envelope membrane, which is clearly separate from Tic110, migrating as a dimer at about 250 kilodalton. Thirdly, we defined the topology of Tic20 in the inner envelope, and found its N- and C-termini to be oriented towards the stromal side. Finally, we successfully reconstituted overexpressed and purified full-length Tic20 into liposomes. Using these Tic20-proteoliposomes, we could demonstrate for the first time that Tic20 can independently form a cation selective channel in vitro.",
    "response": "The presented data provide first biochemical evidence to the notion that Tic20 can act as a channel protein within the chloroplast import translocon complex. However, the very low abundance of Tic20 in the inner envelope membranes indicates that it cannot form a major protein translocation channel. Furthermore, the independent complex formation of Tic20 and Tic110 argues against a joint channel formation. Thus, based on the observed channel activity of Tic20 in proteoliposomes, we speculate that the chloroplast inner envelope contains multiple (at least two) translocation channels: Tic110 as the general translocation pore, whereas Tic20 could be responsible for translocation of a special subset of proteins.",

Baseline blood samples were obtained before the first interferon-beta dose was administered to evaluate MxA mRNA expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic and clinical variables were prospectively recorded to define treatment responder and non responder groups. 104 patients were included in the study. Baseline MxA mRNA expression was significantly lower in the group of patients who met the definition of responders (1.07 vs 1.95, Student t test, p<0.0001). A threshold of 1.096 was established using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis to differentiate between responders and non-responders (sensitivity 73.9%, specificity 69.0%).

    "context": "Thiamine deficiency is a condition that is known to cause damage to the nervous and cardiovascular systems because it interferes with cellular metabolism. It is well known that the control of vascular function is highly dependent on the production of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthases. Studies exploring the physiological relevance of NO signaling under conditions of thiamine deficiency are scarce. The present study sought to investigate whether chronic metabolic changes would cause alterations in vascular responsiveness. By removing thiamine from the diet, we observed a reduced acetylcholine-mediated relaxation and an increased phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aortas containing functional endothelium. Removal of the endothelium or the pre-treatment of vessels with l-NAME restored the contractile responses to the level of controls. Conversely, indomethacin did not modify phenylephrine-mediated contractions. We also used carbon microsensors to continually measure NO production in situ while simultaneously measuring the vascular tone. The results revealed a significant decrease in NO production. Western blot analysis showed a decreased expression of the total eNOS in the thiamine-deficient aorta compared to the control. Concentration-response curves for phenylephrine indicated no difference between the control and deficient groups in the presence and absence of SOD or Tyron. The NO donor DEA-NONOate produced a concentration-dependent relaxation response in the endothelium-denuded vessels that did not differ between the control and thiamine-deficient rats.",

A hilar tumor was defined as a tumor abutting the main renal artery and/or vein or its segmental branches, without invasion. We compared the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates between hilar and nonhilar T1 RCC and analyzed predictors of RFS after nephrectomy. Patients with hilar tumors showed a poorer 5-year RFS compared with nonhilar tumors both in T1a (89.7 vs. 98.5 %, p < 0.001) and T1b (81.6 vs. 95.1 %, p < 0.001) RCCs.

    "context": "Adenoviral-directed enzyme prodrug therapy is a promising approach for head and neck cancer gene therapy. The challenges faced by this approach, however, comprise transient gene expression and dissemination of viruses to distant organs. We used recombinant silk-elastinlike protein polymer (SELP) matrices for intratumoral delivery of adenoviruses containing both thymidine kinase-1 and luciferase genes in a nude mouse model of JHU-022 head and neck tumor. Hydrogels made from two SELP analogues (47K and 815K), with similar silk to elastinlike block ratios but different block lengths, were studied for intratumoral viral delivery. Tumor-bearing mice were followed up for tumor progression and luciferase gene expression concomitantly for 5 weeks. Polymer safety was evaluated through body weight change, blood count, and liver and kidney functions, in addition to gross and microscopic histological examination. SELP-815K analogues efficiently controlled the duration and extent of transfection in tumors for up to 5 weeks with no detectable spread to the liver. An approximately five-fold greater reduction in tumor volume was obtained with matrix-mediated delivery compared to intra-tumoral injection of adenoviruses in saline.

    "context": "The receptor for formylated peptides, formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), potently activates and serves as a chemoattractant receptor for neutrophils. Given the abundance of neutrophils in the inflamed colon, our aim was to determine if the FPR1 mediates colonic neutrophil migration, using the dextran sodium sulfate (DDS)-induced model of colitis. Formyl peptide receptor 1 gene-deficient mice were administered DDS in drinking water for a single 5-day period (acute) or in two 5-day periods separated by 16 days (chronic). At the end of the treatment their colons were excised, measured, and prepared for histological evaluation. FPR1(-/-) mice experienced less severe acute colonic pathology than C57BL/6 (wildtype) mice. The opposite was observed following the second colitis cycle, with FPR1(-/-) mice developing worse pathology than wildtype mice. Both strains had similar numbers of infiltrating neutrophils in ulcerated areas of the colon after a single DSS cycle, but FPR1(-/-) mice had significantly more neutrophils in the ulcerated mucosa after two cycles. There was no difference in the capacity of neutrophils from each strain to migrate to chemoattractants. Since the FPR1(-/-) mice had larger ulcers compared to the wildtype mice, we propose that the FPR1(-/-) mice failed to recover at the same rate as wildtype mice. This apparent difference in restitution could not be attributed to observable differences in annexin A1.",

    "context": "Impaired decision making, a hallmark of addiction, is hypothesized to arise from maladaptive plasticity in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The endocannabinoid system modulates dopamine activity through activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). Here, we investigated whether impulsive behavior observed following cocaine exposure requires CB1R activation. We trained rats in a delay-discounting task. Following acquisition of stable performance, rats were exposed to cocaine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) every other day for 14 days and locomotor activity was measured. Two days later, delay-discounting performance was re-evaluated. To assess reversal of impulsivity, injections of a CB1R antagonist (1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle were given 30 minutes before the task. During the second experiment, aimed at preventing impulsivity rather than reversing it, CB1Rs were antagonized before each cocaine injection. In this experiment, subsecond dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens during delay-discounting sessions before and after cocaine treatment. Blockade of CB1Rs reversed and prevented cocaine-induced impulsivity. Electrochemical results showed that during baseline and following disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, there was a robust increase in dopamine for immediate large rewards compared with immediate small rewards, but this effect reversed when the delay for the large reward was 10 seconds. In contrast, dopamine release always increased for one-pellet options at minimal or moderate delays in vehicle-treated rats.",

However, a recent study failed to find any evidence for audiovisual integration in visual search even when using synchronized audiovisual events. An important question is what information is critical to observe audiovisual integration. Here we demonstrate that temporal coincidence (i.e., synchrony) of auditory and visual components can trigger audiovisual interaction in cluttered displays and consequently produce very fast and efficient target identification. In visual search experiments, subjects found a modulating visual target vastly more efficiently when it was paired with a synchronous auditory signal. By manipulating the kind of temporal modulation (sine wave vs. square wave vs. difference wave; harmonic sine-wave synthesis; gradient of onset/offset ramps) we show that abrupt visual events are required for this search efficiency to occur, and that sinusoidal audiovisual modulations do not support efficient search.",

    "context": "In recent years, there has been a growing understanding that organizational culture is related to an organization's performance. However, few studies have examined organizational culture in medical group practices. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of organizational culture on provider job satisfaction and perceived clinical effectiveness in primary care pediatric practices. This cross-sectional study included 36 primary care pediatric practices located in Connecticut. There were 374 participants in this study, which included 127 clinicians and 247 nonclinicians. Office managers completed a questionnaire that recorded staff and practice characteristics; all participants completed the Organizational Culture Scale, a questionnaire that assessed the practice on four cultural domains (i.e., group, developmental, rational, and hierarchical), and the Primary Care Organizational Questionnaire that evaluated perceived effectiveness and job satisfaction. Hierarchical linear models using a restricted maximum likelihood estimation method were used to evaluate whether the practice culture types predicted job satisfaction and perceived effectiveness. Group culture was positively associated with both satisfaction and perceived effectiveness. In contrast, hierarchical and rational culture were negatively associated with both job satisfaction and perceived effectiveness. These relationships were true for clinicians, nonclinicians, and the practice as a whole.",

    "instruction": "Do platelets convert peripheral blood circulating monocytes to regulatory cells via immunoglobulin G and activating-type Fcγ receptors?",
    "context": "Monocytes and macrophages produce interleukin (IL)-10, an immunoregulatory cytokine and a potent therapeutic tool for immune disorders. Augmentation of IL-10 production with a concomitant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages in vitro is attained by doubly stimulating the cells with a toll-like receptor ligand and immunoglobulin (Ig)G immune complexes, a response known as that of regulatory (or alternatively activated/M2) macrophages. However, it has not been explored sufficiently how such a regulatory response could be exploited for anti-inflammation. Our objective is to find a potential way or condition for augmenting IL-10 by monocytes/macrophages in vivo and in vitro. We show that platelets, when they are opsonized with IgG, can convert human peripheral blood circulating monocytes to IL-10-producing regulatory monocytes in vitro and also in a murine in vivo model. Co-culturing of platelets and monocytes in the presence of anti-integrin IgG and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide augmented IL-10 production via a direct interaction between platelets and monocytes. This novel way of enhancing IL-10 was mediated by activating-type Fc receptors for IgG.",

The serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by ELISA. The expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in lung tissues was determined by Western blot analysis. Administration of UTI reduced the lung wet/dry weight ratio and ameliorated the tissue damage. In the LPS/UTI treatment group, levels of TNF-α were significantly lower than those in the LPS treatment group, while the levels of IL-10 were significantly higher than those in the LPS treatment group. Western blot analysis revealed that UTI inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in lung tissues.",

    "context": "In this study we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effect of carnosol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, in triple negative breast cancer. We found that carnosol significantly inhibited the viability and colony growth induced G2 arrest in the triple negative MDA-MB-231. Blockade of the cell cycle was associated with increased p21/WAF1 expression and downregulation of p27. Interestingly, carnosol was found to induce beclin1-independent autophagy and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The coexistence of both events, autophagy and apoptosis, was confirmed by electron micrography. Induction of autophagy was found to be an early event, detected within 3 h post-treatment, which subsequently led to apoptosis. Carnosol treatment also caused a dose-dependent increase in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (pERK1/2). Moreover, we show that carnosol induced DNA damage, reduced the mitochondrial potential and triggered the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, we found that carnosol induced a dose-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS by tiron, a ROS scavenger, blocked the induction of autophagy and apoptosis and attenuated DNA damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify the induction of autophagy by carnosol.",

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of EBL in the treatment of colonic diverticular hemorrhage compared with those of endoclips. At St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, 66 patients were treated with EBL or endoclips from January 2004 to October 2010. Early rebleeding was defined as clinical evidence of recurrent bleeding within 30 days after initial treatment. Patients' demographics, rate of early rebleeding, and complications were retrospectively evaluated. Of the 66 patients, 18 were treated with EBL. The initial success rate for hemostasis with EBL was 100% with no complications. Early rebleeding was observed in one patient (6%), for whom eversion of a bleeding diverticulum in the sigmoid colon could not be obtained and early loss of the O-band occurred. However, the patient could be retreated with EBL. On the other hand, complete eversion could be obtained for all 10 patients with right-sided diverticula, and no early rebleeding occurred. Endoclips were used to treat 48 patients. Although the initial success rate for hemostasis was 100% without any complications, the rate of early rebleeding was 33% (16 patients), which was significantly higher than the rate for the EBL-treated group (P = 0.018).",

We retrospectively reviewed 79 patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (cT3-4N0-3M0) treated with chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of external-beam radiotherapy to the nasopharynx (70-80 Gy), the lymph node-positive area (60-70 Gy), and the lymph node-negative area (50-60 Gy) combined with 3 cycles of various platinum-based regimens delivered at 3-week intervals. Elevated crp was defined as more than 8 mg/L. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) were used to identify factors significantly associated with prognosis. During the median follow-up of 3.9 years (range: 1-5.5 years), 23 patients died from nasopharyngeal cancer. The 5-year cancer-specific survival (css) rate was 62.90%. Before chemoradiotherapy, 18 patients had high serum crp; the css rate in that subgroup was significantly worse than the rate in the remaining patients (p = 0.0002). Multivariate analysis showed that crp was an independent prognostic indicator of css, with a hazard ratio of 3.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 7.55; p = 0.017).

    "context": "Hyperglycemia selectively triggers apoptosis in tubule and endothelial cells. Taurine, a conditionally essential amino acid, is abundant in several tubule segments, but its role has not been defined fully. It can serve as an osmolyte or as an endogenous antioxidant. Taurine metabolism is altered in diabetes mellitus, with extracellular and intracellular pools reduced. It is still unknown whether taurine can play a role as a protective agent in apoptosis induced by high glucose in tubular cells. Apoptosis (by annexin V binding and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling method), cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation (by fluorescent probe 2'-7' dichlorofluorescin diacetate and FACScan flow cytometry), and Bcl-2 and Bax proteins (by immunostaining) were studied in a human proximal tubular cell line (HK-2) grown in a medium with physiologic (5.5 mM) or high (30 mM) glucose concentrations for 48 hours. In separate experiments, taurine (3-24 mM) was added to the media. The exposure of human tubule cells to 30 mM glucose for 48 hours resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis compared with 5.5 mM glucose (35 +/- 8% vs. 6 +/- 3%, p < 0.001). Thirty mM mannitol failed to induce the effects of high glucose. High glucose-mediated apoptosis was associated with a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 (-87%) and a twofold increase in the expression of Bax protein. Taurine had a dose-dependent effect in preventing high-glucose-induced apoptosis (-78%, p < 0.001 at 24 mM). Moreover, with taurine, intracellular ROS decreased by 34% (p < 0.05), and changes in intracellular ROS formation induced by taurine at 24 hours predicted the variations in the apoptotic index at 48 hours (r = 0.87, p < 0.02).

With transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we evaluated which of the mechanisms of action of TPM detected in vitro are relevant for the modulation of human motor cortex excitability. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design, we investigated the effect of single oral doses of 50 mg and 200 mg TPM on motor thresholds, cortical silent period (CSP), and on intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in 20 healthy subjects.

Focal nonactive MS lesions were classified as T1 isointense, T1 mildly hypointense, and T1 severely hypointense on unenhanced T1-weighted images. Differences among groups were assessed with one-way analysis of variance using the T1 lesion appearance as the grouping factor and either FA or coefficient D(av) as the dependent measure. FA was lowest and coefficient D(av) was highest in T1 severely hypointense lesions, and then, in ascending and descending order, respectively, T1 mildly hypointense lesions and T1 isointense lesions. A significant difference in the values of FA was detected only between T1 isointense lesions and T1 severely hypointense lesions (P <.01), whereas no difference was found between T1 mildly hypointense lesions and either one of these two groups. A significant difference was found in the values of coefficient D(av) among all investigated lesion groups. Coefficient D(av) was found to correlate inversely with the T1-weighted contrast ratio (r=-0.58, P <.0001), whereas FA and deltaFA (percentage of FA variation in the lesion, a relative FA measure that minimizes the effect of FA spatial dependence) were not.",
    "response": "Coefficient D(av) is more sensitive than FA to variations in the degree of T1 hypointensity and, thus, in the amount of the permanent brain tissue damage in patients with MS.",

    "instruction": "Does cyclin D1 sensitize myeloma cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis by activating the unfolded protein response pathway?",
    "context": "Cyclin D1 and its kinase partners control cell cycle progression. Cyclin D1 is frequently deregulated in various cancers, including malignant hemopathies, and tumor cells display uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 is not expressed in the B-cell lineage but is found in multiple myeloma (MM) cells in almost 50% of patients with this condition. Paradoxically, cyclin D1 expression is associated with a good prognosis and longer overall survival in MM patients. We used two independent MM cell lines (RPMI 8226 and LP1) to generate several clones stably expressing either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a GFP-cyclin D1 fusion protein, and we analyzed the properties acquired following cyclin D1 expression. Whole-genome expression analysis in the cell clones indicated that cyclin D1 profoundly modified several cellular functions, including the regulation of apoptotic cell death. We studied the apoptotic response of GFP- and GFP-cyclin D1-expressing clones to bortezomib-treatment. We found that the apoptotic response occurred faster and was of a greater amplitude in cyclin D1-expressing cells. Cyclin D1 expression enhanced the caspase-dependent apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. More importantly, cyclin D1 also activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis.",
    "response": "The ER is well known to be a crucial regulator of plasma cell death and it plays the same role in their malignant counterparts, myeloma cells. This role involves activation of the UPR controlled at least in part by cyclin D1.",

    "context": "During rest and exercise, patients with heart failure hyperventilate; therefore, the diaphragm can be viewed as undergoing constant moderate-intensity exercise. Accordingly, we hypothesized that heart failure elicits adaptations in the diaphragm similar to those elicited by endurance exercise in the limb muscles of normal subjects. Costal diaphragmatic biopsy samples were obtained from 7 normal subjects (age, 36 +/- 20 years) and 10 patients (age, 50 +/- 6 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, 18 +/- 8%) at the time of transplant or left ventricular assist-device placement. We measured the distribution of myosin heavy chain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb by SDS gel electrophoresis. We also measured the activities of the following enzymes: citrate synthase, a marker of oxidative metabolism; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a marker of lipolytic metabolism; and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of glycolytic metabolism. In normal subjects, the distribution of myosin heavy chain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb was 43 +/- 2%, 40 +/- 2%, and 17 +/- 1%, respectively. In contrast, in heart failure subjects, the fiber distribution was 55 +/- 2%, 38 +/- 2%, and 7 +/- 2% for types I, IIa, and IIb, respectively. Therefore, in heart failure, myosin heavy chain I is increased (P < .0001) and myosin heavy chain IIb decreased from normal levels (P < .001). Additionally, citrate synthase activity (normal, 0.33 +/- 0.14; heart failure, 0.54 +/- 0.21 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .05) and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (normal, 0.27 +/- 0.04; heart failure, 0.38 +/- 0.02 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .05) were greater in heart failure patients than in normal subjects, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly less in heart failure patients than in normal subjects (normal, 11.6 +/- 4.6; heart failure,: 4.3 +/- 2.2 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1; P < .01).",
    "response": "In the diaphragm in heart failure, there is a shift from fast to slow myosin heavy chain isoforms with an increase in oxidative capacity and a decrease in glycolytic capacity.

    "context": "High glucose (HG) often induces unfavorable effects on proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This study aimed to explore potential molecular pathways underlying HG functional mechanism during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, involving lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13. Murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured in osteogenic-inducing medium supplemented with high glucose level at 25mM or 5.5mM as normal control. Expression levels of lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13 were measured by using real-time PCR. The mineralized nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were detected after 21 and 7days of incubation respectively. Western blot were also performed to determine the expression of CXCL13 and osteogenic gene markers. Plasmid pcDNAs and small interference RNAs were transfected as indicated for functional analysis of AK028326 and CXCL13. HG suppressed the expression of AK028326 and CXCL13 in MSCs in a time-dependent manner, and also the mineralization, ALP activity, and osteogenic gene expression, which could be reversed by overexpression of AK028326 or CXCL13. CXCL13 expression was positively regulated by AK028326 at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, CXCL13 mediated the positive regulation of AK028326 on osteogenic gene expression in MSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells, mineralization and ALP activity in MSCs and also HG-induced inhibitory effects during MSCs differentiation into osteoblast.",

However, NTHi has also been isolated frequently during clinically stable disease. In this study we tested the hypothesis that genetically distinct NTHi isolates obtained from COPD patients differ in virulence which could account for dissimilarities in the final outcome of an infection (stable vs. exacerbation). NTHi isolates (n = 32) were obtained from stable COPD patients, or during exacerbations. Genetically divergent NTHi isolates were selected and induction of inflammation was assessed as an indicator of virulence using different in vitro models. Despite marked genomic differences among NTHi isolates, in vitro studies could not distinguish between NTHi isolates based on their inflammatory capacities. Alternatively, when using a whole blood assay results demonstrated marked inter-, but not intra-individual differences in cytokine release between healthy volunteers irrespective of the origin of the NTHi isolate used.",

In the current study, we identified mechanisms through which 12/15LO mediates monocyte:endothelial interactions in vivo in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoEKO), a well-characterized mouse model of atherosclerosis. In apoEKO mice that are also deficient in 12/15LO (doubleKO), monocyte adhesion to aorta in vivo was reduced by 95% in doubleKO mice compared with apoEKO mice. Inhibition of 12/15LO in apoEKO mice in vivo using CDC (Cinnamyl-3,4-Dihydroxy-a-Cyanocinnamate) prevented monocyte adhesion to aortic endothelium in apoEKO mice. Aortic endothelium of apoEKO mice had significant activation of rhoA compared with doubleKO aortic endothelium. Further, apoEKO aorta displayed significant activation of NF-kappaB. DoubleKO aorta displayed little nuclear localization of NF-kappaB. Finally, we found significant upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on apoEKO aortic endothelium compared with doubleKO endothelium.

However, this may lose a more clinical readership, thus we use simulation and two case studies to convey our thinking in an easier way. In particular, we consider BG concentration measured after meal and exercise in 12 healthy volunteers, whereas ISF glucose is simulated using a well-accepted model of blood-ISF glucose kinetics, which permits calculation of the equilibration time, a parameter characterizing the system. Two metrics are defined: blood and ISF glucose difference at each time point and time to reach the same glucose value in blood and ISF. The simulation performed and the two metrics show that the relationship between blood-ISF glucose profiles is more complex than a pure shift in time and that the pattern depends on both equilibration time and BG.",

The aims of this paper were to: (1) investigate the association between the food environment at baseline and change in children's saturated fat intake; and (2) to explore whether a change in the food environment was associated with a change in children's saturated fat intake. Secondary analysis of a 12 week cluster randomised controlled trial in 133 4-13 year old children. Families were randomly allocated to parental education regarding changing to reduced-fat dairy foods or a comparison non-dietary behaviour. The interventions were family focused. Parents received education from a dietitian in 3x30 minute sessions to facilitate behaviour change. Parents completed a comprehensive questionnaire capturing three domains of the food environment--Parent knowledge and attitudes; shaping practices; and behaviours and role modelling. Children's dietary intake was assessed via multiple 24-hour recalls at baseline and week 12. Changes in the family food environment and primary outcome (saturated fat) were calculated. Hierarchical linear regression models were performed to explore the association between baseline and change in food environment constructs and change in saturated fat intake. Standardised Beta are presented (p<0.05). After adjustments for child and family demographics, higher levels of perceived food availability (β=-0.2) at baseline was associated with greater reduction in saturated fat intake, where as higher perceived responsibility (β=0.2), restriction (β=0.3) and pressure to eat (β=0.3) were associated with lesser change in saturated fat.

Fifty-one consecutive healthy postmenopausal women (age 48 +/- 5) with negative exercise stress testing were prospectively enrolled into the study. Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained to evaluate the effects of 6 months of HRT on QT intervals, corrected QT intervals (QTcmax and QTcmin), QT dispersion (QTd), and corrected QTd (QTcd). Hormone regimens were continuous 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or 0.625 mg/day CEE alone depending on the hysterectomy status. Although not statistically significant, CEE alone or in combination with MPA increased QTmax and QTmin values. However, the increase in QTmin was greater than the increase in QTmax, which resulted in statistically significant shortening of QTd (P = 0.007 in CEE and P < 0.001 in CEE + MPA groups). There was a significant prolongation of QTcmin values after 6 months in patients assigned to the CEE group (P = 0.001). The QTcd values were significantly shortened by HRT with both regimens (for CEE group 49 +/- 13 ms vs 38 +/- 13 ms, P = 0.01; for CEE + MPA group 49 +/- 14 ms vs 36 +/- 13, P < 0.001).",

    "instruction": "Does mechanosensory organ regeneration in zebrafish depend on a population of multipotent progenitor cells kept latent by Schwann cells?",
    "context": "Regenerating damaged tissue is a complex process, requiring progenitor cells that must be stimulated to undergo proliferation, differentiation and, often, migratory behaviors and morphological changes. Multiple cell types, both resident within the damaged tissue and recruited to the lesion site, have been shown to participate. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation after injury, and their regulation by different cells types, are not fully understood. The zebrafish lateral line is a suitable system to study regeneration because most of its components are fully restored after damage. The posterior lateral line (PLL) is a mechanosensory system that develops embryonically and is initially composed of seven to eight neuromasts distributed along the trunk and tail, connected by a continuous stripe of interneuromastic cells (INCs). The INCs remain in a quiescent state owing to the presence of underlying Schwann cells. They become activated during development to form intercalary neuromasts. However, no studies have described if INCs can participate in a regenerative event, for example, after the total loss of a neuromast. We used electroablation in transgenic larvae expressing fluorescent proteins in PLL components to completely ablate single neuromasts in larvae and adult fish. This injury results in discontinuity of the INCs, Schwann cells, and the PLL nerve. In vivo imaging showed that the INCs fill the gap left after the injury and can regenerate a new neuromast in the injury zone. Further, a single INC is able to divide and form all cell types in a regenerated neuromast and, during this process, it transiently expresses the sox2 gene, a neural progenitor cell marker. We demonstrate a critical role for Schwann cells as negative regulators of INC proliferation and neuromast regeneration, and that this inhibitory property is completely dependent on active ErbB signaling.",
    "response": "The potential to regenerate a neuromast after damage requires that progenitor cells (INCs) be temporarily released from an inhibitory signal produced by nearby Schwann cells. This simple yet highly effective two-component niche offers the animal robust mechanisms for organ growth and regeneration, which can be sustained throughout life.",

We investigated roles of EphB1 receptor in the development of DNP. Diabetic neuropathic pain was produced in male, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats by a single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyse expression of EphB1 receptor as well as the activation of the glial cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. DNP manifested as mechanical allodynia, which was determined by measuring incidence of foot withdrawal in response to mechanical indentation of the hind paw by an electro von Frey filament. Diabetic neuropathic pain and high blood glucose were exhibited simultaneously in around 70% of animals that received i.p. STZ or alloxan. Phosphorylation of EphB1, activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells, and level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β in the spinal cord were significantly increased in rats with DNP. Spinal blocking EphB1 receptor activation in the late phase after STZ injection significantly suppressed the established mechanical allodynia as well as activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells and activity of TNF-α and IL-1β.

Inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL1), are thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced bone loss, but their exact roles are yet to be determined. To determine whether TNF directly triggers bone loss or requires IL1, human TNFalpha mice (hTNFtg) were crossed with mice lacking IL1alpha and IL1beta (IL1(-/-)hTNFtg). Systemic bone architecture was evaluated using CT scanning, static and dynamic bone histomorphometry and serum markers of bone metabolism. hTNFtg mice developed severe bone loss accompanied by a severe distortion of bone microarchitecture. Bone trabeculae were thinner and decreased in numbers, resulting in increased trabecular separation. Histomorphometric analyses revealed strongly increased bone resorption in hTNFtg mice compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, IL1(-/-)hTNFtg mice were fully protected from systemic bone loss despite still developing inflammation in their joints. Lack of IL1 completely reversed increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption in hTNFtg mice and the increased levels of RANKL in these mice. Structural parameters and osteoclast and osteoblast numbers were indistinguishable from wild-type mice.",

In this study the effects of NGF on the cough reflex and airway calibre were investigated in guinea pigs. The involvement of the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway in any NGF-induced effects on cough and airway obstruction was also assessed. Guinea pigs were placed in a transparent whole-body plethysmograph box. Cough was assessed visually, acoustically and by analysis of the airflow signal. Airway obstruction was measured using enhanced pause (Penh) as an index. Exposure of guinea pigs to NGF did not induce a cough response nor a significant airway obstruction. However, exposure of guinea pigs to NGF immediately before citric acid inhalation resulted in a significant increase in the citric acid-induced cough and airway obstruction compared with vehicle-treated animals. Pretreatment with the TrkA receptor antagonist, K252a, or the TRPV1 antagonist, iodoresiniferatoxin, significantly inhibited the NGF-enhanced cough and airway obstruction.

The aim of this study was to measure the role of various clinical determinants on restoration of intestinal function after elective colorectal surgery. From July 2002 to September 2003, all patients who underwent laparotomy for colectomy (laparoscopic resections excluded) with either an ileotransverse, colocolic, or high colorectal anastomosis were entered in this prospective study. The intervals in hours between the end of the surgical procedure and passing of flatus (PG) and passing of stool (PS) were recorded by an independent investigator. PG and PS were eventually correlated with the following parameters: type of colectomy, early removal of nasogastric tube (NGT), mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), type of underlying disease, systemic administration of opiates, and surgical training (colorectal fellowship or other). One hundred twenty-four patients were entered in this study. Four patients (3.2%) developed septic complications (3 anastomotic leaks and 1 intraabdominal abscess) and were excluded from the analysis. Median age in this population was 68 (range 30-95) years.

However, the efficacy could also be explained by the protection of specific sites of the brain. Here, we investigate where is this outcome-related tissue at risk using voxel-based analysis. We included 68 acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion on the admission MRI performed within 6 h of symptoms onset (H6) and 16 controls. MCA recanalization was assessed using the magnetic resonance angiography performed at day 1 (D1). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes were analyzed using a voxel-based method between patients vs. controls group at admission (H6) in non-recanalized vs. recanalized and in 3-month poor vs. good outcome patients at D1. Complete or partial MCA recanalization was observed in 52 of 68 patients. Good outcome at 3 months occurred in 40 patients (59%). In non-recanalized patients, ADC was decreased in the deep MCA and watershed arterial territory (the lenticular nucleus, internal capsule, and the overlying periventricular white matter). This decrease was not observed in recanalized patients at D1 or patients at H6. Fiber tracking suggested that the area is crossed by the cortico-spinal, cerebellar, and intra-hemispheric association tracts. Finally, this area almost co-localized with the area associated with poor outcome.",

The topology of the Ti implants after immobilization of CM was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Ti-immobilized CM was analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The adhesiveness and the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs grown on CM-coated discs were analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.

The localization of the CM was detected by in vivo imaging at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation. The removal torque test and histologic bone implant contact (BIC) were also analyzed. Rat BMSC-CM was successfully immobilized on Ti implants. The immobilized CM contained about 2000 proteins, including collagen type I, bone sialoprotein, fibronectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor that are important in new bone formation. CM promoted cell adhesion and osteocalcin gene expression of rat BMSCs. The labeled CM remained associated with the Ti implant at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days postimplantation.

However, there still seems to be no sustainable consensus regarding the influence on fracture healing patterns. In this study, the influence of calcium and vitamin D levels on fracture callus formation was prospectively analysed using pQCT scan. 94 postmenopausal females with distal radius fractures and consecutive surgery were included. Calcium, 25-[OH]-cholecalciferol, parathyroid hormone and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels were obtained prior surgical treatment and after 6 weeks. A pQCT scan was performed on both sites. Bone mineral density and fracture callus area were determined after detecting the outer border contour at a threshold of 280 mg/ccm. Patients received daily supplements of 1000 mg calcium and 880 IU 25-[OH]-cholecalciferol. Mean 25-[OH]-cholecalciferol level was 19.61 ± 21.87 ng/ml, mean parathyroid hormone level was 52.6 ± 58.9 ng/l and mean Ca level was 2.23 ± 0.35 mmol/l. After 6 weeks of supplementation a significant increase of calcium (p < 0.001) and 25-[OH]-cholecalciferol (p < 0.001), and a significant decrease of parathyroid hormone (p < 0.001) levels were observed.

    "instruction": "Is ethanol-stimulated behaviour in mice modulated by brain catalase activity and H2O2 rate of production?",
    "context": "Over the last few years, a role for the brain catalase-H(2)O(2) enzymatic system has been suggested in the behavioural effects observed in rodents after ethanol administration. This role seems to be related to the ability of cerebral catalase to metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde using H(2)O(2)as a co-substrate. On the other hand, it has been shown that normobaric hyperoxia increases the rate of cerebral H(2)O(2) production in rodents in vivo. Thus, substrate-level changes could regulate brain catalase activity, thereby modulating the behavioural effects of ethanol. The aim of the present study was to assess if the enhancement of cerebral H(2)O(2) production after hyperoxia exposure results in a boost of ethanol-induced locomotion in mice. CD-1 mice were exposed to air or 99.5% O(2) inhalation (for 15, 30, or 45 min) and 0, 30, 60 or 120 min after this treatment, ethanol-induced locomotion was measured. The H(2)O(2)-mediated inactivation of endogenous brain catalase activity following an injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was used as a measure of the rate of cerebral H(2)O(2) production. Hyperoxia exposure (30 or 45 min) potentiated the locomotor-stimulating effects of ethanol (2.5 or 3.0 g/kg), whereas cocaine (4 mg/kg) or caffeine (15 mg/kg)-induced locomotion and blood ethanol levels were unaffected. Moreover, the results also confirmed brain H(2)O(2) overproduction in mice.",
    "response": "The present results suggest that an increase in brain H(2)O(2) production potentiates ethanol-induced locomotion. Therefore, this study provides further support for the notion that the brain catalase-H(2)O(2) system, and by implication centrally formed acetaldehyde, plays a key role in the mediation of ethanol's psychopharmacological effects.",

    "context": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been linked to the pathogenesis of vasculopathies; however, its pathogenic relevance remains to be established. A prerequisite for vascular repair is endothelial cell migration. We evaluated the influence of HCMV on chemokinesis and chemotactic response of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) towards vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A virus dose-dependent reduction in chemokinesis and VEGF-dependent chemotaxis was observed (P < 0.05). UV-inactivated virus did not inhibit chemotaxis or chemokinesis, indicating that viral gene expression is mandatory. We identified two HCMV-induced mechanisms explaining the reduction of chemotaxis: first, a non-ambiguous reduction of VEGFR-2 protein was observed, due to decreased transcription. This protein down-modulation could not be inhibited by Ganciclovir. The remaining VEGFR-2 expressed on infected HCAEC was able to stimulate cell activation. Second, HCMV infection influences actin polymerization in HCAEC as shown by FACS analysis: actin polymerization was significantly reduced to 53 and 51% (P < 0.05) compared with non-infected HCAEC at 24 and 72 h p.i., respectively.

    "context": "Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway occurs in almost all colorectal cancers and contributes to their growth, invasion and survival. Phopholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in progression of colorectal carcinoma However, an understanding of the targets and regulation of this important pathway remains incomplete and besides, relationship between Wnt signaling and PLD is not known. Here, we demonstrate that PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2 are direct targets and positive feedback regulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Wnt3a and Wnt mimetics significantly enhanced the expression of PLDs at a transcriptional level in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, whereas silencing of beta-catenin gene expression or utilization of a dominant negative form of T cell factor-4 (TCF-4) inhibited expression of PLDs. Moreover, both PLD1 and PLD2 were highly induced in colon, liver and stomach tissues of mice after injection of LiCl, a Wnt mimetic. Wnt3a stimulated formation of the beta-catenin/TCF complexes to two functional TCF-4-binding elements within the PLD2 promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppressing PLD using gene silencing or selective inhibitor blocked the ability of beta-catenin to transcriptionally activate PLD and other Wnt target genes by preventing formation of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex, whereas tactics to elevate intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity, enhanced these effects. Here we show that PLD is necessary for Wnt3a-driven invasion and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells.",

These glial processes are thought to play a crucial role in organizing axonal nodal domains during development. However, little is known about the molecules present in Schwann cell processes that could mediate axoglial interactions. The aim of this study is to identify by immunocytochemistry transmembrane proteins enriched in Schwann cells processes that could interact, directly or indirectly, with axonal proteins. We show that syndecan-3 (S3) and syndecan-4 (S4), two proteoglycans expressed in Schwann cells, are enriched in perinodal processes in rat sciatic nerves. S3 labeling was localized in close vicinity of sodium channels as early as post-natal day 2, and highly concentrated at nodes of Ranvier in the adult. S4 immunoreactivity accumulated at nodes later, and was also prominent in internodal regions of myelinated fibers. Both S3 and S4 were co-localized with ezrin in perinodal processes.",

Analysis of volume-kinetics has identified an increase in interstitial fluid volume after crystalloid fluid loading during isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane has also been associated with postoperative hypoxemia and may be associated with an increase in alveolar epithelial permeability, edema formation, and hindered oxygen exchange. In this article, the authors compare fluid extravasation rates before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with isoflurane- versus propofol-based anesthesia. Fourteen pigs underwent 2 h of tepid CPB with propofol (P-group; n = 7) or isoflurane anesthesia (I-group; n = 7). Fluid requirements, plasma volume, colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit levels, and total tissue water content were recorded, and fluid extravasation rates calculated. Fluid extravasation rates increased in the I-group from the pre-CPB level of 0.27 (0.13) to 0.92 (0.36) ml·kg·min, but remained essentially unchanged in the P-group with significant between-group differences during CPB (pb = 0.002).

This study was designed to analyze cell cycle during the process of senescence-like growth arrest in mammary carcinoma cells exposed to X-rays. Fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicators were introduced into the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7. Cell cycle was sequentially monitored by live-cell imaging for up to 5 days after exposure to 10 Gy of X-rays. Live-cell imaging revealed that cell cycle transition from G2 to G1 phase without mitosis, so-called mitotic skipping, was observed in 17.1% and 69.8% of G1- and G2-irradiated cells, respectively. Entry to G1 phase was confirmed by the nuclear accumulation of mKO(2)-hCdt1 as well as cyclin E, which was inversely correlated to the accumulation of G2-specific markers such as mAG-hGeminin and CENP-F. More than 90% of cells skipping mitosis were persistently arrested in G1 phase and showed positive staining for the senescent biochemical marker, which is senescence-associated ß-galactosidase, indicating induction of senescence-like growth arrest accompanied by mitotic skipping. While G2 irradiation with higher doses of X-rays induced mitotic skipping in approximately 80% of cells, transduction of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for p53 significantly suppressed mitotic skipping, suggesting that ionizing radiation-induced mitotic skipping is associated with p53 function.",

Since nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a central regulator of inflammatory processes, we hypothesized that chronically enhanced hepatic NF-κB activation, through hepatocyte-specific expression of IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) (LIKK), will aggravate atherosclerosis development in APOE*3-Leiden (E3L) mice. E3L.LIKK and E3L control littermates were fed a Western-type diet for 24 weeks.

Expression of LIKK did not affect basal levels of inflammatory parameters, but plasma cytokine levels tended to be higher in E3L.LIKK mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. E3L.LIKK mice showed transiently increased plasma cholesterol levels, confined to (V)LDL. This transient character resulted in a mild (+17%) increased cumulative plasma cholesterol exposure.",

    "context": "The type I interferon (IFN) response is a critical component of the innate immune response to infection by RNA viruses and is initiated via recognition of viral nucleic acids by RIG-like receptors (RLR). Engagement of these receptors in the cytoplasm initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, ATF-2 and IRF-3 that coordinately upregulate transcription of type I IFN genes, such as that encoding IFN-β. In this study the impact of poliovirus infection on the type I interferon response has been examined. The type I IFN response was assessed by measuring IFN-β mRNA levels using qRT-PCR and normalizing to levels of β-actin mRNA. The status of host factors involved in activation of the type I IFN response was examined by immunoblot, immunofluorescence microcopy and qRT-PCR. The results show that poliovirus infection results in induction of very low levels of IFN-β mRNA despite clear activation of NF-κB and ATF-2. In contrast, analysis of IRF-3 revealed no transcriptional induction of an IRF-3-responsive promoter or homodimerization of IRF-3 indicating it is not activated in poliovirus-infected cells. Exposure of poliovirus-infected cells to poly(I:C) results in lower levels of IFN-β mRNA synthesis and IRF-3 activation compared to mock-infected cells.

However, in ErbB4-/- HER4(heart) mutant mice in which INs lack ErbB4, these complementary patterns are degraded with considerable overlap evident between IN distribution and NRG expression domains. These findings suggest that NRGs are repellents for migrating ErbB4-expressing INs, a function supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, in collagen co-cultures, MGE-derived cells preferentially migrate away from a source of secreted NRGs. Second, cells migrating from wild-type MGE explants on living forebrain slices from wild-type embryonic mice tend to avoid endogenous NRG expression domains, whereas this avoidance behavior is not exhibited by ErbB4-deficient cells migrating from MGE explants and instead they have a radial pattern with a more uniform distribution. Third, ectopic NRG expression in the IN migration pathway produced by in utero electroporation blocks IN migration and results in cortex distal to the blockade being largely devoid of INs. Finally, fewer INs reach cortex in ErbB4 mutants, indicating that NRG-ErbB4 signaling is required for directing IN migration from the MGE to cortex.",
    "response": "Our results show that NRGs act as repellents for migrating ErbB4-expressing, MGE-derived GABAergic INs and that the patterned expression of NRGs funnels INs as they migrate from the MGE to their cortical destinations.",

    "context": "The standard evaluation of haemoptysis in a department of respiratory medicine would currently consist of chest radiography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and fibre-optic bronchoscopy (FOB), regardless of the result of the CT. Our aim was to evaluate whether patients presenting with haemoptysis but no positive finding on a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest are at risk for having serious disease, first of all lung cancer, and thus whether FOB is mandatory for such patients. We searched the literature and retrospectively reviewed all records of patients referred with haemoptysis between 2000 and 2010 at the Department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. A total of 379 patient records were reviewed for inclusion in the clinical part of the study. Of these, 269 had the information required for the study and had been examined with CT. In all, 16 of the 269 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. In all of these, a tumour or other findings indicating a possible tumour were seen on the chest CT. No additional cases of lung cancer were discovered during FOB, and no cases had been missed by the CT.",

However, the role of nNOS in cardiac electrophysiology after myocardial infarction (MI) is unclear. We hypothesized that nNOS deficiency increases ventricular arrhythmia and mortality after MI. MI was induced in wild-type (WT) or nNOS(-/-) mice by ligation of the left coronary artery. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT mice. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) mice had impaired cardiac function 2 days after MI. Telemetric ECG monitoring showed that compared with WT, nNOS(-/-) mice had significantly more ventricular arrhythmias and were more likely to develop ventricular fibrillation after MI. Treatment with the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil reduced the incidence of arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation in nNOS(-/-) mice after MI. To assess the role of nNOS in Ca2+ handling, patch-clamp and Ca2+ fluorescence techniques were used. Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ currents were higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT cardiomyocytes. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic Ca2+ over a range of pacing frequencies. Treatment with the NO donor S-nitroso N-acetyl-penicillamine decreased Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ current in both nNOS(-/-) and WT cardiomyocytes.

    "context": "The three layer mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade exhibits different designs of interactions between its kinases and phosphatases. While the sequential interactions between the three kinases of the cascade are tightly preserved, the phosphatases of the cascade, such as MKP3 and PP2A, exhibit relatively diverse interactions with their substrate kinases. Additionally, the kinases of the MAPK cascade can also sequester their phosphatases. Thus, each topologically distinct interaction design of kinases and phosphatases could exhibit unique signal processing characteristics, and the presence of phosphatase sequestration may lead to further fine tuning of the propagated signal. We have built four architecturally distinct types of models of the MAPK cascade, each model with identical kinase-kinase interactions but unique kinases-phosphatases interactions. Our simulations unravelled that MAPK cascade's robustness to external perturbations is a function of nature of interaction between its kinases and phosphatases. The cascade's output robustness was enhanced when phosphatases were sequestrated by their target kinases. We uncovered a novel implicit/hidden negative feedback loop from the phosphatase MKP3 to its upstream kinase Raf-1, in a cascade resembling the B cell MAPK cascade. Notably, strength of the feedback loop was reciprocal to the strength of phosphatases' sequestration and stronger sequestration abolished the feedback loop completely. An experimental method to verify the presence of the feedback loop is also proposed. We further showed, when the models were activated by transient signal, memory (total time taken by the cascade output to reach its unstimulated level after removal of signal) of a cascade was determined by the specific designs of interaction among its kinases and phosphatases.",
    "response": "Differences in interaction designs among the kinases and phosphatases can differentially shape the robustness and signal response behaviour of the MAPK cascade and phosphatase sequestration dramatically enhances the robustness to perturbations in each of the cascade. An implicit negative feedback loop was uncovered from our analysis and we found that strength of the negative feedback loop is reciprocally related to the strength of phosphatase sequestration. Duration of output phosphorylation in response to a transient signal was also found to be determined by the individual cascade's kinase-phosphatase interaction design.",

Increased passive resistance in the triceps surae muscles is common following acquired brain injury. Adaptive shortening secondary to relative immobility, and increased stiffness due to rheologic changes within the musculo-tendinous unit, may be exacerbated by plantarflexor muscle overactivity related to the brain injury itself. Three variables representing resistance to passive lengthening and soleus muscle length were compared between subjects with recent brain injury and age matched normal controls. Comparison between limbs was made for subjects with unilateral neurological impairment. Slow passive dorsiflexion stretches were performed using a computer controlled dynamometer. Muscle stiffness in the initial and latter portion of the range, and the angles achieved at torques of 5 and 10 N m were determined from torque-angle curves. Maximal ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed was considered to reflect soleus muscle length. Significant differences were demonstrated for all variables, except passive stiffness near the end of available range. The limb ipsilateral to unilateral brain injury differed from control limbs in that significantly less passive range of dorsiflexion was available and initial resistance to passive stretch was significantly less.",

    "context": "CaMKII contributes to impaired contractility in heart failure by inducing SR Ca(2+)-leak. CaMKII-inhibition in the heart was suggested to be a novel therapeutic principle. Different CaMKII isoforms exist. Specifically targeting CaMKIIδ, the dominant isoform in the heart, could be of therapeutic potential without impairing other CaMKII isoforms. We investigated whether cardiomyocyte function is affected by isoform-specific knockout (KO) of CaMKIIδ under basal conditions and upon stress, i.e. upon ß-adrenergic stimulation and during acidosis. Systolic cardiac function was largely preserved in the KO in vivo (echocardiography) corresponding to unchanged Ca(2+)-transient amplitudes and isolated myocyte contractility in vitro. CaMKII activity was dramatically reduced while phosphatase-1 inhibitor-1 was significantly increased. Surprisingly, while diastolic Ca(2+)-elimination was slower in KO most likely due to decreased phospholamban Thr-17 phosphorylation, frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation was still present. Despite decreased SR Ca(2+)-reuptake at lower frequencies, SR Ca(2+)-content was not diminished, which might be due to reduced diastolic SR Ca(2+)-loss in the KO as a consequence of lower RyR Ser-2815 phosphorylation. Challenging KO myocytes with isoproterenol showed intact inotropic and lusitropic responses. During acidosis, SR Ca(2+)-reuptake and SR Ca(2+)-loading were significantly impaired in KO, resulting in an inability to maintain systolic Ca(2+)-transients during acidosis and impaired recovery.",

    "context": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various cardiac processes including cell proliferation and apoptosis. Pioglitazone (PIO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist, protects against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. We assessed the effects of PPAR-gamma activation on myocardial miRNA levels and the role of miRNAs in IR injury. We evaluated the expression changes of miRNAs in the rat heart after PIO administration using miRNA arrays and then confirmed the result by northern blot. miR-29a and c levels decreased remarkably after 7-day treatment with PIO. In H9c2 cells, the effects of PIO and rosiglitazone on miR-29 expression levels were blocked by a selective PPAR-gamma inhibitor GW9662. Downregulation of miR-29 by antisense inhibitor or by PIO protected H9c2 cells from simulated IR injury, indicated as increased cell survival and decreased caspase-3 activity. In contrast, overexpressing miR-29 promoted apoptosis and completely blocked the protective effect of PIO. Antagomirs against miR-29a or -29c significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and apoptosis in hearts subjected to IR injury. Western blot analyses demonstrated that Mcl-2, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, was increased by miR-29 inhibition.",

Furthermore, if predominant injury is to cholangiocytes, the hepatocytes can transdifferentiate to cholangiocytes to assist in the repair and vice versa, as shown by various fate-tracing studies. However, the molecular bases of reprogramming remain elusive. Using two models of biliary injury where repair occurs through cholangiocyte proliferation and hepatocyte transdifferentiation to cholangiocytes, we identify an important role of Wnt signaling. First we identify up-regulation of specific Wnt proteins in the cholangiocytes. Next, using conditional knockouts of Wntless and Wnt coreceptors low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5/6, transgenic mice expressing stable β-catenin, and in vitro studies, we show a role of Wnt signaling through β-catenin in hepatocyte to biliary transdifferentiation.

Mean recall accuracy was 93% in the PET as well as in the fMRI experiment. During encoding and retrieval we found anterior cingulate cortex activation, and bilateral prefrontal cortex activation in both imaging modalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the precuneus in episodic memory. With PET the results demonstrate frontopolar activations whereas fMRI fails to show activations in this area probably due to susceptibility artifacts.

Adaptations to increased fat intake are relatively slow and are influenced by activity level. We tested the hypothesis that increased levels of daily activity, as influenced by added exercise, would have a graded effect on the rate of compensatory adjustment to a short-term high-fat diet. Daily total energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation were measured at 3 physical activity levels (PALs) by using a whole-room indirect calorimeter in 10 adult women as they transitioned from a 1-d low-fat (30% of energy) control diet to a 4-d high-fat (50% of energy) diet. The 3 PALs (1.4, 1.6, and 1.8) were provided daily by increases in bicycle ergometer exercise time. An increase in physical activity led to a greater increase in the nonprotein respiratory exchange ratio (-0.047 +/- 0.02, -0.064 +/- 0.02, and -0.071 +/- 0.02; P < 0.0001) and 24-h fat oxidation (113 +/- 24, 125 +/- 19, and 147 +/- 20 g/d; P < 0.0001) for PALs of 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8, respectively, after the transition from the low-fat control diet to the high-fat diet.

    "context": "There is increasingly widespread usage of cone-beam CT (CBCT) for guiding radiation treatment in advanced-stage lung tumors, but difficulties associated with daily CBCT in conventionally fractionated treatments include imaging dose to the patient, increased workload and longer treatment times. Respiration-correlated cone-beam CT (RC-CBCT) can improve localization accuracy in mobile lung tumors, but further increases the time and workload for conventionally fractionated treatments. This study investigates whether RC-CBCT-guided correction of systematic tumor deviations in standard fractionated lung tumor radiation treatments is more effective than 2D image-based correction of skeletal deviations alone. A second study goal compares respiration-correlated vs respiration-averaged images for determining tumor deviations. Eleven stage II-IV nonsmall cell lung cancer patients are enrolled in an IRB-approved prospective off-line protocol using RC-CBCT guidance to correct for systematic errors in GTV position. Patients receive a respiration-correlated planning CT (RCCT) at simulation, daily kilovoltage RC-CBCT scans during the first week of treatment and weekly scans thereafter. Four types of correction methods are compared: (1) systematic error in gross tumor volume (GTV) position, (2) systematic error in skeletal anatomy, (3) daily skeletal corrections, and (4) weekly skeletal corrections. The comparison is in terms of weighted average of the residual GTV deviations measured from the RC-CBCT scans and representing the estimated residual deviation over the treatment course. In the second study goal, GTV deviations computed from matching RCCT and RC-CBCT are compared to deviations computed from matching respiration-averaged images consisting of a CBCT reconstructed using all projections and an average-intensity-projection CT computed from the RCCT. Of the eleven patients in the GTV-based systematic correction protocol, two required no correction, seven required a single correction, one required two corrections, and one required three corrections. Mean residual GTV deviation (3D distance) following GTV-based systematic correction (mean ± 1 standard deviation 4.8 ± 1.5 mm) is significantly lower than for systematic skeletal-based (6.5 ± 2.9 mm, p = 0.015), and weekly skeletal-based correction (7.2 ± 3.0 mm, p = 0.001), but is not significantly lower than daily skeletal-based correction (5.4 ± 2.6 mm, p = 0.34). In two cases, first-day CBCT images reveal tumor changes-one showing tumor growth, the other showing large tumor displacement-that are not readily observed in radiographs. Differences in computed GTV deviations between respiration-correlated and respiration-averaged images are 0.2 ± 1.8 mm in the superior-inferior direction and are of similar magnitude in the other directions.",
    "response": "An off-line protocol to correct GTV-based systematic error in locally advanced lung tumor cases can be effective at reducing tumor deviations, although the findings need confirmation with larger patient statistics. In some cases, a single cone-beam CT can be useful for assessing tumor changes early in treatment, if more than a few days elapse between simulation and the start of treatment.

The domain structures of IQGAP family members make them excellent candidates as regulators of the cytoskeleton: their sequences include an actin-binding domain homologous to that found in calponin, IQ motifs for interaction with calmodulin, and a GTPase-binding domain. The genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a single gene encoding an IQGAP family member (denoted IQGAP-related protein: Iqg1). Iqg1 and IQGAPs share similarity along their entire length, with an amino-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domain, IQ repeats, and a conserved carboxyl terminus. In contrast to IQGAPs, Iqg1 lacks an identifiable GAP motif, a WW domain, and IR repeats, although the functions of these domains in IQGAPs are not well defined. Deletion of the IQG1 gene resulted in lethality. Cellular defects included a deficiency in cytokinesis, altered actin organization, aberrant nuclear segregation, and cell lysis. The primary defect appeared to be a cytokinesis defect, and the other problems possibly arose as a consequence of this initial defect. Consistent with a role in cytokinesis, Iqg1 co-localizes with an actin ring encircling the mother-bud neck late in the cell cycle -a putative cytokinetic ring.

This study focused on whether CKI could inhibit MCF-7 SP cells in vitro and in vivo. The analysis of CKI on SP population and the main genes of Wnt signaling pathway were studied first. Then we studied the tumorigenicity of SP cells and the effects of CKI on SP cells in vivo.

The tumor formation rates of each group were compared. The main genes and proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot. CKI suppressed the size of SP population (approximately 90%), and down-regulated the main genes of Wnt signaling pathway. We also determined that MCF-7 SP cells were more tumorigenic than non-SP and unsorted cells. The Wnt signaling pathway was up-regulated in tumors derived from SP cells compared with that in tumors from non-SP cells. The tumor formation rate of the CKI Group was 33% (2/6, P < 0.05), and that of Cisplatin Group was 50%(3/6, P < 0.05), whereas that of the Control Group was 100% (6/6).The RT-PCR and western blot results indicated that CKI suppressed tumor growth by down-regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while cisplatin activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and might spare SP cells.",

Each group was divided into five subgroups sacrificed after 0.5, 2, 6, 12 or 24 hours (n=6/subgroup). Subsequently, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured; caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) proteins were also determined by Western blotting. Furthermore, PCNA was detected by immunohistochemistry to identify the expression site. Serum ALT and AST levels after 2-24 hours of reperfusion in the PHx and IPC groups were remarkably decreased compared to the I/R group, and the serum TNF-alpha was relatively lower. A significant increase of serum IL-6 levels was found in the PHx and IPC groups compared with the I/R group at each time point. Furthermore, PCNA expression was remarkably increased in the IPC group after 6-12 hours of reperfusion, and in the earlier 0.5 and 6 hours time points after reperfusion have shown the massive PCNA-positive hepatocytes. At the same time, the expression of liver p-JNK was higher in the IPC group in the early phase after reperfusion than that of the I/R group and its expression was consistent with the PCNA.",
    "response": "IPC can initiate hepatocyte proliferation in the early phase after ischemia under hemi-hepatectomy, and may be associated with p-JNK expression and triggered by TNF-alpha/IL-6 signals.",

    "context": "We have previously reported that intravenous injection of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) was neuroprotective in an embolic stroke model. We hypothesized that HDL vasculoprotective actions on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may decrease hemorrhagic transformation-associated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration in acute stroke. We used tPA alone or in combination with HDLs in vivo in 2 models of focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (embolic and 4-hour monofilament MCAO) and in vitro in a model of BBB. Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to MCAO, n=12 per group. The rats were then randomly injected with tPA (10 mg/kg) or saline with or without human plasma purified-HDL (10 mg/kg). The therapeutic effects of HDL and BBB integrity were assessed blindly 24 hours later. The integrity of the BBB was also tested using an in vitro model of human cerebral endothelial cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation. tPA-treated groups had significantly higher mortality and rate of hemorrhagic transformation at 24 hours in both MCAO models. Cotreatment with HDL significantly reduced stroke-induced mortality versus tPA alone (by 42% in filament MCAO, P=0.009; by 73% in embolic MCAO, P=0.05) and tPA-induced intracerebral parenchymal hematoma (by 92% in filament MCAO, by 100% in embolic MCAO; P<0.0001). This was consistent with an improved BBB integrity. In vitro, HDLs decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced BBB permeability (P<0.05) and vascular endothelial cadherin disorganization.",

    "context": "2-Methoxystypandrone (2-MS) is a naphthoquinone isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, a Chinese herb used to treat bone diseases. Here we have determined whether 2-MS antagonised osteoclast development and bone resorption. RAW264.7 cells were treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) to induce differentiation into osteoclasts. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyse osteoclast-associated gene expression and signalling pathways. The number of multinuclear osteoclasts, actin rings and resorption pit formation were markedly inhibited by 2-MS, targeting osteoclast differentiation at an early stage and without significant cytotoxicity. The anti-resorption effect of 2-MS was accompanied by decreasing dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA expression. RANKL-increased MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was also attenuated by concurrent, but not by subsequent addition of 2-MS. 2-MS markedly inhibited not only the RANKL-triggered nuclear translocations of NF-kappaB, c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), but also the subsequent NFATc1 induction. Degradation of IkappaB and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were also suppressed. RANKL facilitated the formation of signaling complexes of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TRAF6-TAK1), important for osteoclastogenesis and formation of such signalling complexes was prevented by 2-MS.",

    "instruction": "Does supplementing desflurane with intravenous anesthesia reduce fetal cardiac dysfunction during open fetal surgery?",
    "context": "To lower the incidence and severity of fetal cardiovascular depression during maternal fetal surgery under general anesthesia. We hypothesized that supplemental intravenous anesthesia (SIVA) with propofol and remifentanil would lower the need for high-dose inhalational anesthesia and provide adequate maternal depth of anesthesia and uterine relaxation. SIVA technique would minimize prolonged fetal exposure to deep inhalational anesthetics and significant intraoperative fetal cardiovascular depression. Fetal hypoxia and significant fetal hemodynamic changes occur during open fetal surgery because of the challenges such as surgical manipulation, hysterotomy, uterine contractions, and effects of anesthetic drugs. Tocolysis, a vital component of fetal surgery, is usually achieved using volatile anesthetic agents. High concentrations of volatile agents required to provide an appropriate degree of uterine relaxation may cause maternal hypotension and placental hypoperfusion, as well as direct fetal cardiovascular depression. We reviewed medical records of 39 patients who presented for ex utero intrapartum treatment and mid-gestation open fetal surgery between April 2004 and March 2009. Out of 39 patients, three were excluded because of the lack of echocardiographic data; 18 patients received high-concentration desflurane anesthesia and 18 patients had SIVA with desflurane for uterine relaxation. We analyzed the following data: demographics, fetal medical condition, anesthetic drugs, concentration and duration of desflurane, maternal arterial blood pressure, intraoperative fetal echocardiogram, presence of fetal bradycardia, and need for intraoperative fetal resuscitation. Adequate uterine relaxation was achieved with about 1.5 MAC of desflurane in the SIVA group compared to about 2.5 MAC in the desflurane only anesthesia group (P = 0.0001). More fetuses in the high-dose desflurane group compared to the SIVA group developed moderate-severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction over time intraoperatively (P = 0.02). 61% of fetuses in the high-dose desflurane group received fetal resuscitative interventions compared to 26% of fetuses in the SIVA group (P = 0.0489).",
    "response": "SIVA as described provides adequate maternal anesthesia and uterine relaxation, and it allows for decreased use of desflurane during open fetal surgery. Decreased use of desflurane may better preserve fetal cardiac function.",

The aim of this study was to assess patterns of SCCRO expression in the embryonic murine adrenal gland, and in normal and neoplastic human adrenocortical tissues in order to determine its role as a marker of differentiation in adrenocortical development and neoplastic progression. Murine embryos were procured at developmental stages E8 to E18. A tissue microarray was constructed containing 38 normal, 39 adenomatous, and 87 carcinomatous human adrenocortical specimens. Immunohistochemistry for SCCRO was performed and its expression was graded in suitable tissues. SCCRO expression was detected in the murine adrenal cortex as early as E15 and persisted into the postnatal period. High-level SCCRO expression was identified in 94% of normal (32/34) and adenomatous (29/31) adrenocortical specimens but in only 63% (45/72) of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) specimens ( P = .001).

Epidemiological studies report an inverse association between dietary flavonoid consumption and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. We studied the potential beneficial effects of dietary supplementation of red wine polyphenol extract, Provinols, on obesity-associated alterations with respect to metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular functions in Zucker fatty (ZF) rats. ZF rats or their lean littermates received normal diet or supplemented with Provinols for 8 weeks. Provinols improved glucose metabolism by reducing plasma glucose and fructosamine in ZF rats. Moreover, it reduced circulating triglycerides and total cholesterol as well as LDL-cholesterol in ZF rats. Echocardiography measurements demonstrated that Provinols improved cardiac performance as evidenced by an increase in left ventricular fractional shortening and cardiac output associated with decreased peripheral arterial resistances in ZF rats. Regarding vascular function, Provinols corrected endothelial dysfunction in aortas from ZF rats by improving endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (Ach). Provinols enhanced NO bioavailability resulting from increased nitric oxide (NO) production through enhanced endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) activity and reduced superoxide anion release via decreased expression of NADPH oxidase membrane sub-unit, Nox-1. In small mesenteric arteries, although Provinols did not affect the endothelium-dependent response to Ach; it enhanced the endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor component of the response.",

Fifty-eight knee computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on patients who underwent primary or revision transtibial single-bundle ACL reconstruction, and three-dimensional reconstructions of the CT scans were aligned within an anatomical coordinate system. The position of femoral tunnel aperture centers was measured with (1) the quadrant method and (2) in the anatomic posterior-to-anterior and proximal-to-distal directions. The position of tibia tunnel aperture centers were measured similarly, in the anterior-to-posterior and medial-to-lateral dimensions on the tibial plateau. Comparisons were made to previously established anatomical tunnel positions, and data were presented as \"mean value ± standard deviation (range).\" The location of tibial tunnels was at 48.0 ± 5.4% (35.6-59.5%) of the anterior-to-posterior plateau depth and at 47.9 ± 2.9% (42.2-57.4%) of the medial-to-lateral plateau width.

Early repolarization (ER) is a specific type of repolarization abnormality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between LVFTs and ER. This study retrospectively included 99 consecutive healthy subjects and 33 patients with ER. Early repolarization was defined as an elevation of the QRS-ST junction of >0.1 mV from baseline in at least 2 inferior or lateral leads, manifested as QRS slurring or notching. Each participant was examined using echocardiography with second harmonic imaging, and the attachments of the LVFTs were recorded. A total of 93 LVFTs were present in 82 (83%) of the 99 healthy subjects. Of these 93 LVFTs, the majority (79/93, or 84.9%) were longitudinal-type LVFTs, which originated from the basal interventricular septum (IVS) and progressed toward the apical segment of the left ventricular free wall. There were significant differences in the positioning of the LVFTs between the ER patients and control (P < 0.0001). LVFTs between mid-IVS to the middle of the LV free wall were found more common in patients with ER compared with control subjects (47.5% vs. 6.5%, P < 0.0001). In the ER group, LVFTs between the basal IVS to the apical segment of LV free wall were only identified in 21% of the LVFTs, compared to a value of 84.9% for the control group (P < 0.0001).

Recently, we demonstrated that ureteral obstruction in adult rats is associated with reduction in the abundance of renal aquaporins (AQPs) and renal sodium transporters, which paralleled an impaired urinary concentrating capacity. In the present study, renal handling of sodium and water, together with the expression of renal aquaporins and major renal sodium transporters, was examined in rats with neonatally induced partial unilateral ureteral obstruction (PUUO) within the first 48 hours of life to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the tubular functional defects in response to congenital obstruction. Rats were then followed for 12 or 24 weeks. Neonatal PUUO caused a progressive reduction in single kidney glomerular filtration rate (SKGFR) on the obstructed side to 43% of controls at 12 weeks (115 +/- 28 vs. 267 +/- 36 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05), and 31% of controls at 24 weeks (106 +/- 24 vs. 343 +/- 41 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05).

We investigated whether there was a direct link between androgens and another key regulator of stromal cells, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ). Prostate stromal cells were freshly obtained and cultures derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression in dihydrotestosterone treated and untreated cells was compared using Affymetrix gene expression arrays and Ca2+ regulated features were identified by Gene Ontology (GO). Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined in Fluo-4 loaded cells. Androgen regulation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitaion. Stromal cell cultures were sorted for expression of integrin α1 β1 , which enriched for cells expressing the androgen receptor (AR). We identified key functional categories, within the androgen-induced gene expression signature, focusing on genes involved in calcium signaling. From this analysis, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) was identified as a significantly differentially expressed gene with four relevant associated GO terms. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region of STIM1 contained putative androgen response element sequences in which AR binding ability of STIM1 was confirmed. Androgens directly regulated STIM1 expression and STIM1 effects on store-operated calcium entry were inhibited by STIM1 knock-down.

    "context": "Effects of probiotics on the prevention of atopic diseases have been proposed recently. Although we have already reported the suppressive effects of the probiotic, ImmuBalance™, on a mouse model for peanuts allergy, its influence on atopic diseases remains unclear. Potential efficacy of ImmuBalance™, which is the fermented soy product, on treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) was investigated using a mouse model for human AD, NC/Tnd mice. For in vivo study, ImmuBalance containing chow or a control diet were fed to NC/Tnd mice with moderate dermatitis for 2 weeks. Topical application of FK506 ointment was used as a positive control. Clinical skin severity scores, scratching behaviors, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and histological features were analyzed. For in vitro study, suppressive effect of ImmuBalance™ on nerve growth factor (NGF)-activated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was examined. Clinical skin severity scores of the mice fed with ImmuBalance containing chow were gradually reduced as well as the mice treated with FK506. Feeding with ImmuBalance completely inhibited the increase in scratching behavior of NC/Tnd mice. The value of TEWL of NC/Tnd mice fed with ImmuBalance was significantly decreased. In addition, histological examination revealed that application of ImmuBalance decreased the number of PGP9.5-positive neuronal fibers in the lesional skin. When ImmuBalance extract was added to the culture, NGF-activated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was diminished through the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphorylation.",

    "context": "Heart failure (HF), a debilitating disease in a growing number of adults, exerts structural and neurohormonal changes in both cardiac and skeletal muscles. However, these alterations and their affected molecular pathways remain uncharacterized. Disease progression is known to transform skeletal muscle fiber composition by unknown mechanisms. In addition, perturbation of specific hormonal pathways, including those involving skeletal muscle insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFB-5) appears to occur, likely affecting muscle metabolism and regeneration. We hypothesized that changes in IGF-1 and IGFB-5 mRNA levels correlate with the transformation of single-skeletal muscle fiber myosin heavy chain isoforms early in disease progression, making these molecules valuable markers of skeletal muscle changes in heart failure. To investigate these molecules during \"early\" events in HF patients, we obtained skeletal muscle biopsies from New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II HF patients and controls for molecular analyses of single fibers, and we also quantified isometric strength and muscle size. There were more (P < 0.05) single muscle fibers coexpressing two or more myosin heavy chains in the HF patients (30% ± 7%) compared to the control subjects (13% ± 2%). IGF-1 and IGFBP-5 expression was fivefold and 15-fold lower in patients with in HF compared to control subjects (P < 0.05), respectively. Strikingly, there was a correlation in IGF-1 expression and muscle cross-sectional area (P < 0.05) resulting in a decrease in whole-muscle quality (P < 0.05) in the HF patients, despite no significant decrease in isometric strength or whole-muscle size.",

Mapping of major Cry1A resistance genes has linked resistance to the ABCC2 locus in Heliothis virescens, Plutella xylostella, Trichoplusia ni and Bombyx mori, and mutations in this gene have been found in three of these Bt-resistant strains. We have used a colony of Spodoptera exigua (Xen-R) highly resistant to a Bt commercial bioinsecticide to identify regions in the S. exigua genome containing loci for major resistance genes by using bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Results reveal a region containing three genes from the ABCC family (ABBC1, ABBC2 and ABBC3) and a mutation in one of them (ABBC2) as responsible for the resistance of S. exigua to the Bt commercial product and to its key Spodoptera-active ingredients, Cry1Ca. In contrast to all previously described mutations in ABCC2 genes that directly or indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the ABCC2 mutation found in S. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in ATP binding. Functional analyses of ABBC2 and ABBC3 support the role of both proteins in the mode of action of Bt toxins in S. exigua. Partial silencing of these genes with dsRNA decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. In addition, reduction of ABBC2 and ABBC3 expression negatively affected some fitness components and induced up-regulation of arylphorin and repat5, genes that respond to Bt intoxication and that are found constitutively up-regulated in the Xen-R strain.",

Among six experienced institutions, 150 dobutamine stress echocardiograms (dobutamine up to 40 microg x kg(-1) min(-1) and atropine up to 1 mg) were performed on patients with suspected coronary artery disease using fundamental and harmonic imaging following a consistent digital acquisition protocol. Each dobutamine stress echocardiogram was assessed at every institution regarding endocardial visibility and left ventricular wall motion without knowledge of any other data using standardized reading criteria. No patients were excluded due to poor image quality or inadequate stress level. Coronary angiography was performed within 4 weeks. Coronary angiography demonstrated significant coronary artery disease (> or = 50% diameter stenosis) in 87 patients. Using harmonic imaging an average of 5.2+/-0.9 institutions agreed on dobutamine stress echocardiogram results as being normal or abnormal (mean kappa 0.55; 95% CI 0.50-0.60).

The RIZ1 form is usually absent or expressed at low levels in tumor cells, whereas RIZ2 is frequently expressed. We investigated a possible involvement of RIZ1 in differentiation control using a myeloid cell maturation model that is easily modulated by retinoids and other agents. HL60 or NB4 cell lines or patients' leukemic promyelocytes were treated with all- trans -retinoic acid or other agents to induce differentiation. RIZ gene expression was determined with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNase protection assay. Immunocytochemistry was performed to assess variation of the intracellular distribution of RIZ protein on all- trans-retinoic acid treatment. Forced expression of RIZ1 protein was obtained with a recombinant adenovirus containing RIZ1 cDNA. Treatment with retinoic acid induced a selective expression of RIZ1 in HL60 cell line. Retinoic acid effect was maximal at 7 days and correlated to the granulocytic differentiation of cells. A similar effect was obtained in retinoic acid-sensitive NB4 cell line or in patients' leukemic promyelocytes, but not in the retinoic acid-resistant cell line NB4.007/6 or in the U937 cell line. Selective expression of RIZ1 was also induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in the U937 and HL60 cell lines and by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) only in HL60 cells. In HL60 cells, RIZ1 was also induced by activation of a retinoid alpha receptor-independent maturation pathway based on retinoid X receptor agonist and protein kinase A synergism. In addition, retinoic acid produced a redistribution of the antigen within the nucleus in these cells. Forced expression of RIZ1 protein induced growth arrest and death of HL60 cells.",

To discover whether antihypertensive treatment with an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker is accompanied by an increase in sympathoadrenomedullary activity, we studied plasma catecholamine kinetics before and during treatment with doxazosin. Eleven patients with essential hypertension were studied before and after 3 months' treatment with doxazosin (4-8 mg a day). 3H-noradrenaline and 3H-adrenaline were infused simultaneously and blood samples were collected to calculate plasma catecholamine kinetics before and during sympatho-adrenomedullary stimulation (lower-body negative pressure). Doxazosin decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and forearm vascular resistance, whereas the heart rate did not change significantly. During doxazosin, baseline arterial plasma noradrenaline increased from 0.97 +/- 0.07 to 1.21 +/- 0.07 nmol/l, and this appeared to be due to an increase in total body noradrenaline spillover from 1.54 +/- 0.15 to 1.84 +/- 0.16 nmol/min; noradrenaline clearance did not change significantly. Forearm noradrenaline spillover also increased, from 0.89 +/- 0.18 to 1.48 +/- 0.23 pmol/100 ml per min. In contrast, arterial plasma adrenaline, total body adrenaline spillover and adrenaline clearance were not significantly affected by doxazosin treatment.

Women were recruited from primary care antenatal services and underwent ultrasonography to determine femur (FLZ) and humerus (HLZ) length z scores. The duration of in utero TDF exposure was calculated in weeks. Linear regression models were applied to assess the associations between the duration of in utero TDF exposure and change in FLZ and HLZ. A total of 646 woman/fetus dyads contributed 1376 ultrasonographic scans to this analysis: 132 dyads with ≥25 weeks, 326 with 10-24 weeks, and 188 with <10 weeks of TDF exposure.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of the transmembrane serine proteinase matriptase in cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis (OA). Serine proteinase gene expression in femoral head cartilage obtained from either patients with hip OA or patients with fracture to the neck of the femur (NOF) was assessed using a low-density array. The effect of matriptase on collagen breakdown was determined in cartilage degradation models, while the effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. ProMMP processing was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/N-terminal sequencing, while its ability to activate proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) was determined using a synovial perfusion assay in mice. Matriptase gene expression was significantly elevated in OA cartilage compared with NOF cartilage, and matriptase was immunolocalized to OA chondrocytes. We showed that matriptase activated proMMP-1 and processed proMMP-3 to its fully active form. Exogenous matriptase significantly enhanced cytokine-stimulated cartilage collagenolysis, while matriptase alone caused significant collagenolysis from OA cartilage, which was metalloproteinase-dependent. Matriptase also induced MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression. Synovial perfusion data confirmed that matriptase activates PAR-2, and we demonstrated that matriptase-dependent enhancement of collagenolysis from OA cartilage is blocked by PAR-2 inhibition.",

The current study was performed to determine which tissues release ATP in an ABCC6-dependent manner in vivo, where released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi, and whether human PXE ptients have low plasma PPi concentrations. Using cultured primary hepatocytes and in vivo liver perfusion experiments, we found that ABCC6 mediates the direct, sinusoidal, release of ATP from the liver. Outside hepatocytes, but still within the liver vasculature, released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi.

    "context": "Ziprasidone (Zeldox) is a novel antipsychotic with a unique combination of antagonist activities at monoaminergic receptors and transporters and potent agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors. 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism may be an important feature in ziprasidone's clinical actions because 5-HT(1A) agonists increase cortical dopamine release, which may underlie efficacy against negative symptoms and reduce dopamine D(2) antagonist-induced extrapyramidal side effects. This study investigated the in vivo 5-HT(1A) agonist activity of ziprasidone by measuring the contribution of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation to the ziprasidone-induced cortical dopamine release in rats. Effects on dopamine release were measured by microdialysis in prefrontal cortex and striatum. The role of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation was estimated by assessing the sensitivity of the response to pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635. For comparison, the D(2)/5-HT(2A) antagonists clozapine and olanzapine, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol, the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 and the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT were included. Low doses (<3.2 mg/kg) of ziprasidone, clozapine, and olanzapine increased dopamine release to approximately the same extent in prefrontal cortex as in striatum, but higher doses (> or =3.2 mg/kg) resulted in an increasingly preferential effect on cortical dopamine release. The 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT produced a robust increase in cortical dopamine (DA) release without affecting striatal DA release. In contrast, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol selectively increased striatal DA release, whereas the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 had no effect on cortical or striatal DA release. Prior administration of WAY-100635 completely blocked the cortical DA increase produced by 8-OHDPAT and significantly attenuated the ziprasidone- and clozapine-induced cortical DA increase. WAY-100635 pretreatment had no effect on the olanzapine-induced DA increase.",

    "context": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the expression of p75 nerve growth factor receptor (p75NGFR) in human cross-facial nerve grafts and to compare the immunohistological findings with patient data and the functional outcome in facial reanimation. The study comprised 37 sural nerve graft specimens. All of the patients had long-lasting complete facial paralysis and were operated on by the standard two-stage procedure involving cross-facial nerve grafts and microneurovascular muscle transfer. Nerve biopsies were taken 4 to 20 months (mean, 8 months) after the cross-facial nerve grafting. Immunohistochemistry for p75NGFR as well as for Schwann cells (S-100; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and for Neurofilament-200 (NF-200; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) was performed. In graft biopsies, the mean number of NF-200-positive axons amounted to 38% (range, 6-81%) of that in control samples. Further, regenerated axons were thinner than in control samples. Morphologically, the grafted nerves were characterized by fibrosis and invasion of inflammatory cells. A longer time between cross-facial nerve grafting and biopsy sampling correlated with a higher number of viable axons (NF-200) (P = 0.002). In all cases, expression of p75NGF receptor was clearly higher at the distal end of the grafted nerve. Expression of p75NGFR was lower in older than in younger patients (P = 0.003). A high expression of p75NGFR was often seen with better function of the transplanted muscle.",
    "response": "Increased expression of p75NGFR in human nerve grafts was noted, especially in younger patients. We suggest that p75NGFR expression might be a contributing factor in a successful axonal regeneration and eventual recovery of muscle function.",

    "context": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease prevalent in elderly men. However, the genetic determinants of BPH remain unclear. Because BPH and prostate cancer (PCa) share some common pathological characteristics, we investigated whether susceptibility loci for PCa contributed to BPH risk and BPH aggressiveness in Chinese men. Fourteen SNPs associated with PCa risk in a Chinese population were genotyped in 426 BPH cases (184 aggressive and 242 non-aggressive BPH cases) and 1,008 controls. The association between the SNPs and BPH risk/aggressiveness was estimated using logistic regression analysis. In addition, effects of the 14 SNPs on BPH related clinical traits, including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, total PSA, and free PSA were evaluated using linear regression analysis. Two SNPs, rs12621278 in ITGA6 at 2q31 (OR = 0.82, P = 0.05) and rs339331 in RFX6 at 6q22 (OR = 1.22, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with BPH. In addition, rs12621278 (OR = 0.73, P = 0.05) and rs12653946, 13 kb upstream of IRX4 at 5p15 (OR = 1.40, 0.03), were significantly associated with aggressive BPH. Moreover, the risk allele of rs12621278 (G) and rs12653946 (T) for aggressive BPH were significantly associated with elevated IPSS after treatment (P = 0.01).",
    "response": "This is the first systematic investigation on the contributions of PCa susceptibility loci to risk and aggressiveness of BPH. Our findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of BPH, especially aggressive BPH. In addition, our results provide new insights into the genetic determinants shared between BPH and PCa.",

    "context": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) structural core and non-structural NS5A proteins induce in liver cells a series of intracellular events, including elevation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Since oxidative stress is associated to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, we aimed to investigate the effect of these proteins on Ca(2+) mobilization in human hepatocyte-derived transfected cells, and the protective effect of quercetin treatment. Ca(2+) mobilization and actin reorganization were determined by spectrofluorimetry. Production of ROS/RNS was determined by flow cytometry. Cells transfected with NS5A and core proteins showed enhanced ROS/RNS production and resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, and reduced Ca(2+) concentration into the stores. Phenylephrine-evoked Ca(2+) release, Ca(2+) entry and extrusion by the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase were significantly reduced in transfected cells. Similar effects were observed in cytokine-activated cells. Phenylephrine-evoked actin reorganization was reduced in the presence of core and NS5A proteins. These effects were significantly prevented by quercetin. Altered Ca(2+) mobilization and increased calpain activation were observed in replicon-containing cells.",
