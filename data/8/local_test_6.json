    "context": "B-cell-activating factor belonging to the tumour necrosis factor family (BAFF) is known for its role in the survival and maturation of B cells. It has been recently suggested that BAFF also plays important roles in T-cell activation in T-cell mediated diseases such as psoriasis. To investigate the role of BAFF in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). BAFF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in skin samples (24 CTCL cases and seven healthy controls) and in skin-derived fibroblasts (five CTCL cases and five healthy controls) was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also performed immunohistochemical staining for BAFF and its receptors. Serum BAFF levels were measured in patients with CTCL (n=46), atopic dermatitis (n=36) or psoriasis (n=27) and 27 healthy controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lesional skin of CTCL contained higher levels of BAFF mRNA than normal skin and the expression levels correlated with disease activity. BAFF mRNA expression levels were elevated in fibroblasts from CTCL skin. Tumour cells in the lesional skin of CTCL expressed BAFF and its receptors, while fibroblasts expressed only BAFF. Serum BAFF levels of CTCL patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls and correlated with types of skin lesions and clinical stages. They also significantly correlated with serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor and lactate dehydrogenase levels.",

    "context": "Endothelial apoptosis plays an important role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. It would be useful to clarify whether activation of non-neuronal muscarinic receptor (NNMR) could prevent endothelial apoptosis and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of NNMR activation on regulating rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) apoptosis induced by homocysteine, an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis, and further studied its molecular mechanism. RAECs were incubated using homocysteine at the concentration of 2.7 mmol/L for 36 h. RAECs were also pre-treated with carbachol or arecoline to examine their effects. RT-PCR was used to assess changes in the gene expression related to cell apoptosis. Incubation of RAECs with homocysteine at the concentration of 2.7 mmol/L resulted in morphologic changes, such as cellular shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and margination. These could be attenuated by pretreatment with carbachol and arecoline at the concentration of 10 micromol/L for 12 h. Homocysteine induced apoptosis in RAECs and the molecular mechanisms were associated with the regulation of fas, fas-L and caspase-8 in the death receptor pathway, bcl-2, bcl-xL and bax in the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-12 in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway and caspase-3, caspase-6 and p53 as downstream effectors. Carbachol and arecoline attenuated the effects of homocysteine on genes in the death receptor pathway, in the mitochondrial pathway and in the downstream pathway. Atropine could reverse all of the effects of arecoline.",

Between 2009 and 2014, we included 18 children with CP. The first part of the study was a randomized double-blind trial with allocation to either LIA or placebo for postoperative pain management, in addition to intravenous or oral analgesia. In the second part of the study, the children were consecutively included for postoperative pain management with epidural analgesia in addition to intravenous or oral analgesia. The primary outcome was postoperative pain 4 h postoperatively using 2 pain assessment tools (r-FLACC and VAS-OBS) ranging from 0 to 10.

The RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of albiflorin, paeoniflorin, or paeonol. Global mRNA expression levels were detected by using an oligonucleotide microarray platform covering the mouse whole genome. Treatment with LPS caused expression level changes in 1,270 genes by 2 folds or more. Paeonol attenuated the induction level of 355 LPS-responsive genes. Classification of the genes targeted by paeonol according to the Panther group analysis revealed 20 biological processes, 24 molecular functions, and 22 signaling pathways. The Panther signaling pathways highly affected by paeonol included the 'inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling', 'interleukin signaling', and 'Toll receptor signaling'.",

    "context": "The majority of gastric cancer cases are believed to be caused by chronic infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and atrophic corpus gastritis is a predisposing condition to gastric cancer development. We aimed to increase understanding of the molecular details of atrophy by performing a global transcriptome analysis of stomach tissue. Biopsies from patients with different stages of H. pylori infection were taken from both the antrum and corpus mucosa and analyzed on microarrays. The stages included patients without current H. pylori infection, H. pylori-infected without corpus atrophy and patients with current or past H. pylori-infection with corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis. Using clustering and integrated analysis, we found firm evidence for antralization of the corpus mucosa of atrophy patients. This antralization harbored gain of gastrin expression, as well as loss of expression of corpus-related genes, such as genes associated with acid production, energy metabolism and blood clotting. The analyses provided detailed molecular evidence for simultaneous intestinal metaplasia (IM) and spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) in atrophic corpus tissue. Finally, acidic mammalian chitinase, a chitin-degrading enzyme produced by chief cells, was shown to be strongly down-regulated in corpus atrophy.",

Although numerous studies on miRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have also attempted to identify prognostic biomarkers, more large-scale clinical studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of the results. Present study aimed to identify prognosis-related molecular subtypes of primary pancreas tumors using miRNA expression profiling. Expression profiles of 1733 miRNAs were obtained by using microarray analysis of 104 pancreatic tumors of Korean patients. To detect subgroups informative in predicting the patient's prognosis, we applied unsupervised clustering methods and then analyzed the association of the molecular subgroups with survival time. Then, we constructed a classifier to predict the subgroup using penalized regression models. We have determined three pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor subtypes associated with prognosis based on miRNA expression profiles. These subtypes showed significantly different survival time for patients with the same clinical conditions. This demonstrates that our prognostic molecular subgroup has independent prognostic utility. The molecular subtypes can be predicted with a classifier of 19 miRNAs. Of the 19 signature miRNAs, miR-106b-star, miR-324-3p, and miR-615 were related to a p53 canonical pathway, and miR-324, miR-145-5p, miR-26b-5p, and miR-574-3p were related to a Cox-2 centered pathway.",

Patients with psoriasis exposed to trauma were randomly matched to up to five unexposed psoriasis controls based on gender, age, duration of psoriasis and the date of entry into THIN. Trauma exposure was stratified into subgroups of joint, bone, nerve and skin trauma. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the HRs for developing PsA. For comparison, an identical analysis was performed in the entire THIN population evaluating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk following physical trauma. Patients with psoriasis exposed to trauma (N=15 416) and matched unexposed patients (N=55 230) were followed for a total of 425 120 person-years during which 1010 incident PsA cases were recorded.

We previously estimated that about 2% of PrCa cases diagnosed ≤ 55 years harbour a BRCA2 mutation and PrCa among BRCA2 carriers has been shown to be more aggressive, with poorer survival. To further evaluate the role of BRCA2 in PrCa predisposition, we screened 1864 men with PrCa aged between 36 and 88 years. We analysed the BRCA2 gene using a novel high-throughput multiplex fluorescence heteroduplex detection system developed for the ABI3130xl genetic analyzer. We identified 19 protein-truncating mutations, 3 in-frame deletions and 69 missense variants of uncertain significance (UV) in our sample set. All the carriers of truncating mutations developed PrCa at ≤ 65 years, with a prevalence of BRCA2 mutation of 1.20% for cases in this age group.",
    "response": "Based on the estimated frequency of BRCA2 mutations in the United Kingdom we estimate that germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene confer an ∼ 8.6-fold increased risk of PrCa by age 65, corresponding to an absolute risk of ∼ 15% by age 65. These results suggest that routine testing of early onset PrCa cases for germline BRCA2 mutations will further help to refine the prevalence and risk associated with BRCA2 mutations and may be useful for guiding management options.",

We have examined a well-characterised series of 1872 invasive breast carcinomas with a long term follow-up to assess the clinical significance of BP. A pragmatic definition of the BP as immunophenotypic evidence of basal cytokeratins CK5/6 and/or CK14 expression was used. These tumours were associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free interval in our series as a whole and in both the lymph node (LN) negative and LN positive subgroups. When stratified by histological grade, BP was of highly significant prognostic value in grade 3 but not in grades 1 or 2 tumours. Similarly, it was associated with poor survival in the moderate group of the Nottingham prognostic Index but not in the other groups. In a subgroup comprising LN negative grade 3 tumours, BP was the most powerful prognostic marker followed only by tumour size, while the other variables were non-significant. Patients with BP were more likely to respond to chemotherapy than those with non-basal tumours.",

Octreotide scintigraphy has been claimed to differentiate active from inactive disease. Here we study the intraobserver variability and diagnostic accuracy of the quantitative measurement of orbital octreotide uptake. Twenty-two consecutive patients with moderately severe ophthalmopathy were treated with retrobulbar radiotherapy. Pretreatment octreotide scintigraphic data were related to the response at six months after radiotherapy, using Receiving-Operator-Characteristic curves. Octreotide uptake was measured at 4 and 24 h after i.v. injection of approximately 3 mCi (= 111 MBq; range 75-150 MBq) 111Indium-DTPA-Octreotide with a neuro-SPECT camera. Counts were measured in fixed regions-of-interest in 4 transversal slices of the orbit, the temporal and the occipital area. Measurements were done twice and intraobserver variability was analysed by coefficients of variations (CV). Uptake is expressed as orbital/background ratio. The nature of the temporal uptake was studied by matching an octreoscan with a technetium scan and MRI. Intra-observer variability of measuring octreotide uptake was acceptable, and the coefficient of variation slightly better using the orbital/occipital ratio (11%), than the orbital/temporal ratio (16%). From matching studies it appears that the temporal uptake takes place, in part, in the parotid gland. The orbital/occipital ratio was used to predict the outcome of radiotherapy. Mean (+/- SD) uptake on the 4 h scan was higher in responders (2.2 +/- 0.66) than in nonresponders (1.7 +/- 0.39; P = 0.04).

    "context": "Lamotrigine (LTG) is a popular modern antiepileptic drug (AED); however, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully understood, as it is known to modulate many members of several ion channel families. In heterologous systems, LTG inhibits Cav 2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which contribute to kainic-acid (KA)-induced epilepsy in vivo. To gain insight into the role of R-type currents in LTG drug action in vivo, we compared the effects of LTG to two other AEDs in Cav 2.3-deficient mice and controls on KA-induced seizures. Behavioral seizure rating and quantitative electrocorticography were performed after injection of 20 mg/kg (and 30 mg/kg) KA. One hour before KA injection, mice were pretreated with 30 mg/kg LTG, 50 mg/kg topiramate (TPM), or 30 mg/kg lacosamide (LSM). Ablation of Cav 2.3 reduced total seizure scores by 28.6% (p = 0.0012), and pretreatment with LTG reduced seizure activity of control mice by 23.2% (p = 0.02). In Cav 2.3-deficient mice, LTG pretreatment increased seizure activity by 22.1% (p = 0.018) and increased the percentage of degenerated CA1 pyramidal neurons (p = 0.02). All three AEDs reduced seizure activity in control mice; however, only the non-calcium channel modulating AED, LSM, had an anticonvulsive effect in Cav 2.3-deficient mice. Furthermore, LTG altered electrocorticographic parameters differently in the two genotypes: decreasing relative power of ictal spikes in control mice but increasing relative power of high frequency fast ripple discharges during seizures in Cav 2.3-deficient mice.",
    "response": "These findings provided the first in vivo evidence for an essential role for Cav 2.3 in LTG pharmacology and shed light on a paradoxical effect of LTG in their absence. Furthermore, LTG appears to promote ictal activity in Cav 2.3-deficient mice by increasing high frequency components of seizures, resulting in increased neurotoxicity in the CA1.

However, the role of GRN in the pathogenic process of LN still remains obscure. In this study, we explored its potential role and underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of LN. We found that serum GRN levels were significantly up-regulated and were positively correlated with the severity of LN. Overexpression of GRN in vivo by transgenic injection remarkably exacerbated LN, whereas down-regulation of GRN with shRNA ameliorated LN, firmly demonstrating the critical role of GRN in the pathogenesis of LN. Notably, macrophage phenotype analysis revealed that overexpression of GRN could enhance macrophage polarization to M2b, a key mediator of the initiation and progression of LN. On the contrary, down-regulation of GRN resulted in impaired M2b differentiation, thus ameliorating LN.

Five putative functional polymorphisms were tested for associations with virologic suppression within 1 year after NNRTI initiation in women naive to antiretroviral agents (n = 91). Principal components were generated to control for population substructure. Logistic regression was used to test the joint effect of rs3745274 and rs28399499, which together indicate slow, intermediate, and extensive metabolizers. Rs3745274 was significantly associated with virologic suppression [odds ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-11.22, P trend = 0.03]; the remaining polymorphisms tested were not significantly associated with response. Women classified as intermediate and slow metabolizers were 2.90 (95% CI 0.79-12.28) and 13.44 (95% CI 1.66 to infinity) times as likely to achieve virologic suppression compared to extensive metabolizers after adjustment for principal components (P trend = 0.005).

In a cohort of 565 consecutive hepatitis B-related HCC patients who underwent major liver resection, the characteristics and clinical outcomes after liver resection were compared between patients with immediate postoperative platelet count < 100 × 10(9)/L and patients with platelet count ≥ 100 × 10(9)/L. Risk factors for postoperative hepatic insufficiency were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Patients with a low immediate postoperative platelet count (< 100 × 10(9)/L) had more grade III-V complications (20.5% vs 12.4%, P = 0.016), and higher rates of postoperative liver failure (6.8% vs 2.6%, P = 0.02), hepatic insufficiency (31.5% vs 21.2%, P < 0.001) and mortality (6.8% vs 0.5%, P < 0.001), compared to patients with a platelet count ≥ 100 × 10(9)/L. The alanine aminotransferase levels on postoperative days 3 and 5, and bilirubin on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5 were higher in patients with immediate postoperative low platelet count. Multivariate analysis revealed that immediate postoperative low platelet count, rather than preoperative low platelet count, was a significant independent risk factor for hepatic insufficiency.",

The Expanded Program on Immunization Contact Method (EPI-CM) is a proposed, less resource-intensive method in which health center staff incorporate health behavior questions into routine vaccination activities. No systematic evaluation of EPI-CM validity has yet been conducted. We used concurrent household survey and EPI-CM to collect data on 4 infant health behaviors in Mali at 2 time points (8 total comparisons). Studied health behaviors were bednet use, obtaining care for fever, obtaining care for a respiratory complaint, and using oral rehydration solution for diarrhea. Household survey and EPI-CM estimates were considered equivalent if a 95% confidence interval about the difference in estimated proportions fell within the interval (-.10, .10). EPI-CM estimates were higher than household survey estimates for 7 of 8 unadjusted paired estimates; estimates of bednet use in 2009 met a priori equivalence criteria in a setting of high bednet use (90.5%). When we restricted household survey data to infants up-to-date on vaccinations, estimates for behaviors other than bednet use remained substantially different.",

    "context": "Schistosomiasis affects nearly 40 million women of reproductive age, and is known to elicit a pro-inflammatory signature in the placenta. We have previously shown that antigens from schistosome eggs can elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine production from trophoblast cells specifically; however, the influence of these antigens on other characteristics of trophoblast function, particularly as it pertains to placentation in early gestation, is unknown. We therefore sought to determine the impact of schistosome antigens on key characteristics of first trimester trophoblast cells, including migration and invasion. First trimester HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells were co-cultured with plasma from pregnant women with and without schistosomiasis or schistosome soluble egg antigens (SEA) and measured cytokine, cellular migration, and invasion responses. Exposure of HTR8 cells to SEA resulted in a pro-inflammatory, anti-invasive signature, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) and TIMP-1. Additionally, these cells displayed 62% decreased migration and 2.7-fold decreased invasion in vitro after treatment with SEA. These results are supported by increased IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture media of HTR8 cells exposed to plasma from Schistosoma japonica infected pregnant women.",

The manifestation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1995-2005) and the progression of atherosclerosis (1995-2000) were carefully assessed. The TL was shorter in men than in women (age-adjusted mean [95% CI], 1.41 [1.33 to 1.49] versus 1.55 [1.47 to 1.62]; P=0.02) and inversely correlated to age (r=-0.22, P<0.001) and family history of CVD (P=0.03). Participants with CVD events during follow-up (n=88) had significantly shorter telomeres (age- and sex-adjusted mean [95% CI], 1.25 [1.08 to 1.42] versus 1.51 [1.45 to 1.57]; P<0.001). In multivariable Cox models, baseline TL emerged as a significant and independent risk predictor for the composite CVD end point and its individual components (myocardial infarction and stroke); however, this was not the case for de novo stable angina and intermittent claudication. Subjects in the top and bottom TL tertile group differed in their CVD risk by a factor of 2.72 (95% CI, 1.41 to 5.28), which is the risk ratio attributable to a 13.9-year difference in chronological age. Remarkably, in our atherosclerosis progression model, TL was strongly associated with advanced, but not early, atherogenesis. All findings were consistent in women and men.",

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a hallmark feature in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for liver injury. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of IH on OSC expression and evaluate the role of OSC in the IH-induced apoptosis in hepatic cell line human liver cell (HL-02). HL-02 cells were exposed to normoxia or IH. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to value cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis. The expression of OSC messenger RNA (mRNA) was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, and the expression of OSC protein was determined by Western blot. To further investigate the function of OSC in IH-induced apoptosis, oxidosqualene cyclase-enhanced green fluorescence protein (OSC-EGFP) plasmid was constructed to over-express OSC protein. Triglyceride content in HL-02 cells was analyzed by oil red staining or Triglyceride Quantification Kit. We found that IH inhibited HL-02 cell proliferation and accelerated cell apoptosis.

The presence and functional activity of SK channels were therefore investigated in the human lens. The expression of all three members of the SK channel family was quantified by PCR. Their functional activity was investigated by using electrophysiological and calcium-imaging techniques. Lens voltage was monitored by inserting a single electrode into the intact human lens, and changes in intracellular calcium were recorded simultaneously after fura-2 incorporation. Expression of all three SK family members was detected in both anterior and equatorial lens epithelial cells. Application of either G-protein (e.g., adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) or tyrosine kinase (EGF) receptor agonists induced a hyperpolarization of lens voltage that was accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium. The calcium ionophore ionomycin also induced a rapid hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarizing responses were abolished by apamin and trifluoperazine and were accentuated by the SK channel activator 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO).",

Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, may exert efficacy in TNBC through its multiple cellular effects. Here, we tested the efficacy of bortezomib and examined the drug mechanism in breast cancer cells. Five breast cancer cell lines: TNBC HCC-1937, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468; HER2-overexpressing MDA-MB-453; and estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 were used for in vitro studies. Apoptosis was examined by both flow cytometry and Western Blot. Signal transduction pathways in cells were assessed by Western Blot. Gene silencing was done by small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo efficacy of bortezomib was tested in nude mice with breast cancer xenografts. Immunohistochemical study was performed on tumor tissues from patients with TNBC. Bortezomib induced significant apoptosis, which was independent of its proteasome inhibition, in the three TNBC cell lines, but not in MDA-MB-453 or MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), a cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediated the apoptotic effect of bortezomib. We showed that bortezomib inhibited CIP2A in association with p-Akt downregulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all sensitive TNBC cells, whereas no alterations in CIP2A expression and p-Akt were noted in bortezomib-resistant cells. Overexpression of CIP2A upregulated p-Akt and protected MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing CIP2A by siRNA overcame the resistance to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In addition, bortezomib downregulated CIP2A mRNA but did not affect the degradation of CIP2A protein. Furthermore, bortezomib exerted in vivo antitumor activity in HCC-1937 xenografted tumors, but not in MCF-7 tumors. Bortezomib downregulated CIP2A expression in the HCC-1937 tumors but not in the MCF-7 tumors. Importantly, CIP2A expression is readily detectable in tumor samples from TNBC patients.",

Twenty-four osteochondral lesions were created in sheep femoral condyles. The animals were randomised to three treatment groups: scaffold, scaffold loaded with autologous PRP, and empty defect (control). The animals were sacrificed and evaluated six months after surgery. Gross evaluation and histology of the specimens showed good integration of the chondral surface in both treatment groups. Significantly better bone regeneration and cartilage surface reconstruction were observed in the group treated with the scaffold alone. Incomplete bone regeneration and irregular cartilage surface integration were observed in the group treated with the scaffold where PRP was added.

    "context": "The functional state of glial cells, like astrocytes and microglia, critically modulates the course of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and can have both detrimental and beneficial effects. Glial cell function is tightly controlled by cellular interactions in which cytokines are important messengers. Recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. During the course of CNS diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease, and in the corresponding animal models, the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation, arguing for an important role of these chemokines and their corresponding receptor CXCR3 in glial activation. To clarify the role of this chemokine system in glial cell activation, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 on glial activation in a model of toxic demyelination in which glial activation without a prominent influx of hematogenous cells is prototypical. We investigated the impact of CXCR3 on cuprizone-induced demyelination, comparing CXCR3-deficient mice with wild type controls. The clinical course during cuprizone feeding was documented for five weeks and for the subsequent four days withdrawal of the cuprizone diet (5.5 weeks). Glial activation was characterized using histological, histomorphometric and phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis for (de)myelination and neuroinflammation was applied to characterize the effect of cuprizone on CXCR3-deficient mice and control animals. CXCR3-deficient mice displayed a milder clinical course during cuprizone feeding and a more rapid body weight recovery after offset of diet. In the CNS, CXCR3 deficiency significantly attenuated the accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a deficiency of CXCR3 reduced the expression of the microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. Compared to controls, we observed a vast reduction of RNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines like Ccl2, Cxcl10, Tnf and Il6 within the CNS of cuprizone-treated mice. Lastly, CXCR3 deficiency had no major effects on the course of demyelination during cuprizone feeding.",

In contrast, adenosine concentrations were unaffected by intravenous remifentanil. These results suggest that intrathecal but not systemic opioid analgesia in humans is associated with spinal release of adenosine.",
    "response": "Although the role of adenosine release in the spinal cord for opioid receptor activation in subsequent analgesia from opioids is controversial in laboratory studies, these clinical data suggest that local opioid receptor stimulation in the spinal cord of humans does release adenosine. Whether adenosine participates in analgesia from spinal opioids in humans is not known, but spinal adenosine itself is analgesic in humans, consistent with an opioid-adenosine role in analgesia.",

Unfortunately, most PNES studies include few males and do not consider possible gender differences, making findings less generalizable to males with PNES. In this study we specifically compare males with PNES to females with PNES and to males with epilepsy. Males with PNES (n=58), males with epilepsy (n=86), females with PNES (n=147), and females with ES (n=142) were evaluated on an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit. Self-reported objective measures of psychopathology, demographics, and PNES seizure semiology were compared. Personality Assessment Inventory profiles revealed marked differences, particularly in somatic symptoms, between PNES and epilepsy. Females with PNES had higher levels of physiological depressive symptoms but lower antisocial features. Males with PNES who had clinically significant elevations on the somatic complaints scale were much more likely to have motor seizures while females with PNES classified similarly were equally likely to have either motor or non-motor events.",

    "context": "The adoptive transfer of T cells modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprised of an extracellular single-chain antibody (scFV) fragment specific for a tumor cell surface molecule, and linked to an intracellular signaling module, has activity in advanced malignancies. The receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a tumor-associated molecule expressed in prevalent B-lymphoid and epithelial cancers and is absent on normal mature B cells and vital tissues, making it a candidate for CAR T-cell therapy. We constructed ROR1-CARs from scFVs with different affinities and containing extracellular IgG4-Fc spacer domains of different lengths, and evaluated the ability of T cells expressing each CAR to recognize ROR1(+) hematopoietic and epithelial tumors in vitro, and to eliminate human mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) engrafted into immunodeficient mice. ROR1-CARs containing a short \"Hinge-only\" extracellular spacer conferred superior lysis of ROR1(+) tumor cells and induction of T-cell effector functions compared with CARs with long \"Hinge-CH2-CH3\" spacers. CARs derived from a higher affinity scFV conferred maximum T-cell effector function against primary CLL and ROR1(+) epithelial cancer lines in vitro without inducing activation-induced T-cell death. T cells modified with an optimal ROR1-CAR were equivalently effective as CD19-CAR-modified T cells in mediating regression of JeKo-1 MCL in immunodeficient mice.",

Upon challenge with microbes and inflammatory triggers, neutrophils release enzymes and nuclear material, forming neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) and thereby dying by NETosis. We herein tested NET formation and NETosis products in high glucose and in the setting of type 2 diabetes (T2D). NETosis was assessed in vitro in cells exposed to 0, 5, 25 mM glucose and 25 mM mannitol, DMSO and PMA using immunofluorescence staining for elastase, DNA and chromatin. Single-cell morphometric analysis was used to detect enter of elastase in the nucleus and extrusion of nuclear material. Release of NETs was quantified by staining with Hoechst 33342. In 38 T2D and 38 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic individuals, we determined plasma elastase, mono- and oligonucleosomes and double-strand (ds) DNA, as circulating NETosis products. NETosis was accurately reproduced in vitro: high (25 mM) glucose increased NETosis rate and release of NETs compared with 5 mM glucose and 25 mM mannitol. T2D patients showed increased plasma elastase, mono- and oligonucleosomes and dsDNA compared with non-diabetic control individuals. A positive correlation was found between HbA1c and mono- and oligonucleosomes, whereas dsDNA was correlated with the presence of nephropathy and cardiovascular disease.

Poisson regression was used to estimate the odds of significant events for each systemic therapy; UVB-treated patients served as a control population. Methotrexate seemed to be the most prescribed medication. Adverse events were noted with all forms of systemic psoriasis therapy. The highest event rate was seen with oral retinoids, though most of these were considered minor (64%). Cyclosporine had the highest significant adverse event rate (0.9 events/patient). For 'significant' adverse events, oral agents had an adjusted odds ratio>6 compared to standard UVB therapy. The highest risk was for cyclosporine (OR = 20.3); however, the estimate was imprecise (95% confidence interval [4.3, 96.6]).",

The objectives were to determine the association of smoking with radiographic patterns and to evaluate the associations of these smoking-related radiographic patterns on airflow obstruction in sarcoidosis. Clinical data and computed tomography (CT) scans of 124 patients with sarcoidosis were reviewed. CT scans were assessed for lymph nodes, nodules, bronchiectasis, bronchovascular bundle thickening, displaced hilum, fibrosis, ground glass, emphysema, pleural changes, and alveolar opacities. CT patterns were compared between patients with and without a history of smoking. The effect of smoking on the associations between radiographic patterns and airflow obstruction was assessed with multivariable analysis. Smokers had less frequency of bronchovascular bundle thickening than nonsmokers (11/38 subjects [29%] vs 50/86 subjects [58%], P = .003) and more emphysema (7/38 subjects [18%] vs 1/86 subjects [1%], P = .001).

However, this behaviour presents a considerable risk as landing flies are exposed to predators as well as the host's own defense reactions such as tail flicking. Achieving a successful blood meal within the shortest time span is therefore at a premium in tsetse, so feeding until replete normally lasts less than a minute. Biting in blood sucking insects is a multi-sensory response involving a range of physical and chemical stimuli. Here we investigated the role of heat and humidity emitted from host skin on the biting responses of Glossina pallidipes, which to our knowledge has not been fully studied in tsetse before. The onset and duration of the biting response of G. pallidipes was recorded by filming movements of its haustellum in response to rapid increases in temperature and/or relative humidity (RH) following exposure of the fly to two airflows. The electrophysiological responses of hygroreceptor cells in wall-pore sensilla on the palps of G. pallidipes to drops in RH were recorded using tungsten electrodes and the ultra-structure of these sensory cells was studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Both latency and proportion of tsetse biting are closely correlated to RH when accompanied by an increase of 13.1°C above ambient temperature but not for an increase of just 0.2°C.

Accordingly, we analyzed the prognostic impact of AQP5 expression in a large number of patients with early breast cancer (EBC). AQP5 expression was investigated on the basis of the immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray specimens from 447 EBC patients who underwent surgery between 2003 and 2008. We scored the staining intensity (0 through 3) and percentage of positive tumor cells (0 through 4), and the staining score was defined as sum of these scores used to categorize the AQP5 expression as negative (0 through 2), weak (3 through 5), or strong (6 or more). A total of 267 (59.7%) patients were identified as AQP5-positive (staining score >2), including 123 (27.5%) cases of strong expression (stating score >5). In a univariate analysis, AQP5 overexpression was significantly associated with survival for the patients with ER/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressed EBC. Moreover, a multivariate survival analysis revealed that AQP5 overexpression was an independent prognostic marker of survival for the EBC patients, which was prominent in patients with ER/PR-positive tumor. However, no difference in AQP5 expression was observed on the basis of patient and tumor characteristics.",

    "context": "Skin biopsies allow for direct phenotyping of the endothelium in clinical settings. We hypothesize that in murine sepsis endothelial activation is manifested by changes in protein and mRNA expression in skin biopsies, and that such alterations differ from other organs. In two mouse models of sepsis [endotoxemia and cecal ligation puncture (CLP)], we measured circulating levels of endothelial biomarkers, quantitated mRNA expression of activation markers and assayed for protein expression using immunohistochemistry. Endotoxemic mice demonstrated increased circulating levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin at 24 h, while CLP was associated with increased levels of sE-selectin alone. In real-time PCR, mRNA levels for P-selectin, ICAM-1 and PAI-1 were increased in skin from endotoxemic mice. In CLP, mRNA levels for P-selectin, ICAM-1, E-selectin and PAI-1 were elevated, while VCAM-1 expression was reduced in skin.

    "instruction": "Is hIF-1 alpha a regulator of galectin-3 expression in the intervertebral disc?",
    "context": "The regulation of galectin-3 expression in skeletal tissues is not completely understood. Our studies indicate that HIF-1 alpha regulates galectin-3 expression by interacting with hypoxia regulatory elements in the promoter region. Finally, we show that galectin-3 serves a prosurvival role in the intervertebral disc. Earlier reports indicated that galectin-3 (gal-3) is highly expressed in the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage and the intervertebral disc. Because these skeletal tissues have a limited vascular supply and the cells reside in a low O2 environment, we determined if the oxemic status modulates gal-3 expression. Cells were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (2% O2), and gal-3 expression and promoter activity were evaluated. Interaction of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha with the gal-3 promoter was confirmed by gel shift and site-directed mutagenesis. There was minimal oxygen-dependent change in HIF-1 alpha levels and no change in gal-3 expression and promoter activity in nucleus pulposus cells. In contrast, hypoxia induced gal-3 mRNA, protein, and promoter activity in HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from HIF-1 alpha wildtype but not HIF-1-null mice. To evaluate the importance of HIF-1 in regulation of gal-3 expression, we overexpressed HIF-1 alpha or constitutively active-HIF-1 alpha in null MEF. An increase in gal-3 promoter activity was observed in both normoxia and hypoxia. Similarly, suppression of HIF-1 alpha in nucleus pulposus cells, and wildtype MEF, using siRNA and pharmacological inhibitors resulted in suppression of gal-3 promoter activity and mRNA levels. Analysis of the gal-3 promoter indicated that it contained two hypoxia response elements (HREs). Gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that there was binding of HIF-1 alpha to the gal-3 HRE. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of HRE completely blocked hypoxic induction of gal-3 promoter activity. In nucleus pulposus cells, suppression of gal-3 expression promoted FasL-mediated apoptosis.",

Twenty-six consecutive patients (24 men; mean age 74.7 ± 8.3 years) underwent LOC between June 2006 and April 2013 at our institution. The mean interval from index EVAR to LOC was 40.4 ± 29.2 months (range 5-93 months). The indication for LOC was endoleak in 14 (54%) patients and infection in 12 (46%): 2 (8%) patients with endoleak had a ruptured aneurysm and 6 (23%) patients with infection had a recurrent secondary aortoesophageal fistula (sAEF). In all 12 cases of infection and in 12 of 14 endoleaks, the entire endograft was explanted. A rifampin-soaked Dacron silver graft was implanted in all patients with infection. Patients with any infection and with recurrent AEF required more blood units than patients with endoleak (6.40 vs. 1.86, p = 0.045; 6.76 vs. 1.86, p = 0.0036, respectively).

Through attending physicians, the authors recruited French Canadian patients with HSAN2. Exclusion of linkage to the known HSAN loci and linkage to the HSAN2 was performed using standard methods. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene was used to uncover the causal mutations. A large cluster of HSAN2 patients comprising 16 affected individuals belonging to 13 families was identified. The mode of inheritance is clearly autosomal recessive. All patients originated from southern Quebec, and 75% are from the Lanaudière region. Whereas linkage to the HSAN1, 3, and 4 loci was excluded, linkage to the 12p13.33 HSAN2 locus was confirmed. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene uncovered two French Canadian mutations and a novel nonsense mutation in a patient of Lebanese origin, all predicted to lead to truncations of the HSN2 protein.

The mechanical properties of clots were determined in vitro by elasticity and plasticity tests. One hour after embolism, thrombolysis was started by intra-arterial application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) (10 mg/kg). Treatment efficacy was monitored by MR measurements of blood perfusion, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 relaxation time and blood-brain barrier permeability, and by pictorial measurements of ATP and pH. Thrombin-induced clots were classified as elastic, and spontaneously forming clots were classified as plastic. Middle cerebral artery embolism with thrombin-induced or spontaneously forming clots led to similar reduction of perfusion and ADC, but rtPA treatment efficacy differed greatly. In the spontaneously forming clot group, blood perfusion returned to or above control within 2 hours, ADC and ATP normalized, tissue pH exhibited alkalosis, and T2 and blood-brain barrier permeability did not change. In the thrombin-induced clot group, in contrast, blood reperfusion was delayed, ADC and ATP remained reduced, tissue pH was acidic, and edema developed, as reflected by increased T2 and blood-brain barrier permeability.",

In bryophytes representing basal lineage of land plants, there is little data regarding the mechanisms that control this transition. Two species from bryophytes - moss Physcomitrella patens and liverwort Marchantia polymorpha are under advanced molecular and genetic research. The goal of our study was to identify genes connected to female gametophyte development and archegonia production in the dioecious liverwort Pellia endiviifolia species B, which is representative of the most basal lineage of the simple thalloid liverworts. The utility of the RDA-cDNA technique allowed us to identify three genes specifically expressed in the female individuals of P.endiviifolia: PenB_CYSP coding for cysteine protease, PenB_MT2 and PenB_MT3 coding for Mysterious Transcripts1 and 2 containing ORFs of 143 and 177 amino acid residues in length, respectively. The exon-intron structure of all three genes has been characterized and pre-mRNA processing was investigated. Interestingly, five mRNA isoforms are produced from the PenB_MT2 gene, which result from alternative splicing within the second and third exon. All observed splicing events take place within the 5'UTR and do not interfere with the coding sequence. All three genes are exclusively expressed in the female individuals, regardless of whether they were cultured in vitro or were collected from a natural habitat. Moreover we observed ten-fold increased transcripts level for all three genes in the archegonial tissue in comparison to the vegetative parts of the same female thalli grown in natural habitat suggesting their connection to archegonia development.",

    "context": "Between 2004 and 2009, the incidence of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Denmark has almost doubled. It has been speculated that this increase may be a result of patients being operated on weaker indications. The purpose of this study was to compare preoperative degrees of osteoarthritis and health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving primary TKA in 2004 and 2009. We identified 154 and 369 primary TKAs inserted at our institution in 2004 and 2009, respectively. Patients had been invited to complete the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire preoperatively. Two groups of patients that were representative with regard to age and gender were randomly sampled and compared (n = 44 in 2004 versus n = 106 in 2009). The Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade of osteoarthritis was assessed on preoperative radiographs in all patients. We found no statistically significant differences in gender distribution or mean age at surgery. We reached K-L grades of 3-4 in 52.4% and 49.6% in 2004 and 2009, respectively (p = 0.57). The preoperative mean SF-36 physical component scores were 32.6 and 33.7, respectively (p = 0.44).

    "context": "Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for the development of kidney injury. Considering that female sex hormones may play a preventative role in both cardiovascular and renal diseases, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of female sex hormones on hypercholesterolemia-induced renal dysfunction. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE) and C57 control female mice underwent an ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgery and after 2 months, creatinine clearance, uremia and proteinuria were determined. Renal oxidative stress and lipid deposition were also quantified. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Creatinine clearance (μL/min) was similar between C57 (171 ± 17) and ApoE (140 ± 26) mice underwent sham surgery. OVX resulted in a reduced glomerular filtration rate in both C57 (112 ± 8, ~ - 35%, p < 0.05) and ApoE (61 ± 10, ~ - 56%, p < 0.05) animals. Plasma levels of urea (mg/dL) were higher in both ApoE groups (Sham: 73 ± 7; OVX: 73 ± 8, p < 0.05) when compared to C57 animals (Sham: 49 ± 3; OVX: 60 ± 4), with no changes among ovariectomized groups. Proteinuria levels (mg/24 h) were similar between C57 (Sham: 25.1 ± 5.7; OVX: 33.7 ± 4.7) and ApoE sham animals (26.4 ± 3.5), however, 24-h urine protein excretion was augmented in ApoE OVX animals (49.6 ± 5.8, p < 0.05). Histological kidney analysis demonstrated that the absence of female sex hormones resulted in increased oxidative stress, which was more severe in ApoE mice (C57 Sham: 9.2 ± 0.4; C57 OVX: 22.9 ± 1.0; ApoE Sham: 13.9 ± 0.7; ApoE OVX: 34.0 ± 1.4 au x 103, p < 0.05). As expected, ApoE mice presented higher lipid deposition, which was not affected by OVX (C57 Sham: 0 ± 0; C57 OVX: 0 ± 0; ApoE Sham: 6.8 ± 1.6; ApoE OVX: 5.2 ± 0.8% x 10-2, p < 0.05).

We investigated the effects of poly-ADP-ribose synthetase inhibition on myocardial and endothelial function during reperfusion in an experimental model of cardiopulmonary bypass. Twelve anesthetized dogs underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. After 60 minutes of hypothermic cardiac arrest, reperfusion was started after application of either saline vehicle (control, n = 6) or PJ34 (10 mg/kg), a potent poly-ADP-ribose synthetase inhibitor (n = 6). Biventricular hemodynamic variables were measured by means of a combined pressure-volume conductance catheter, and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationships was calculated at baseline and after 60 minutes of reperfusion. Left anterior descending coronary blood flow, endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine, and endothelium-independent vasodilatation to sodium nitroprusside were also determined. The administration of PJ34 led to a significantly better recovery of left and right ventricular systolic function (P <.05) after 60 minutes of reperfusion. In addition, the inotropic adaptation potential of the right ventricle to an increased afterload was better preserved in the PJ34 group. Coronary blood flow was also significantly higher in the PJ34 group (P <.05). Although the vasodilatory response to sodium nitroprusside was similar in both groups, acetylcholine resulted in a significantly higher increase in coronary blood flow in the PJ34 group (P <.05).",

Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is caused by mutations in the Delta7 sterol-reductase gene (DHCR7; EC 1.3.1.21), which impair endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis and make the growing embryo dependent on exogenous (maternal) sources of cholesterol. We have investigated whether apolipoprotein E, a major component of the cholesterol transport system in human beings, is a modifier of the clinical severity of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Common apo E, DHCR7, and LDLR genotypes were determined in 137 biochemically characterised patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and 59 of their parents. There was a significant correlation between patients' clinical severity scores and maternal apo E genotypes (p = 0.028) but not between severity scores and patients' or paternal apo E genotypes. In line with their effects on serum cholesterol levels, the maternal apo epsilon2 genotypes were associated with a severe Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome phenotype, whereas apo E genotypes without the epsilon2 allele were associated with a milder phenotype. The correlation of maternal apo E genotype with disease severity persisted after stratification for DHCR7 genotype. There was no association of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome severity with LDLR gene variation.",

Consecutive patients undergoing attempted BNTI or orotracheal intubation were included. Five paramedic units were trained to use an ETT with triggeractivated distal tip directional control for BNTIs (intervention group). Ten units used conventional ETTs for BNTIs and served as concurrent controls (control group). Subjects in the 2 groups were enrolled concurrently with nonrandomized allocation based on the agency providing service. An intubation attempt was defined by tube passage, and success was defined as confirmed endotracheal placement. A total of 219 BNTIs were studied (141 in the control group and 78 in the intervention group).

Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the secondary metabolites in the aqueous extract of Mangifera indica leaves and its acclaimed antidiarrhoeal activity in rats. The aqueous leaf extract of Mangifera indica was screened for its constituent secondary plant metabolites. In each of the diarrhoeal models, female albino rats were assigned into 5 groups (A, B, C, D and E) containing five animals each such that rats in groups A and B were the positive and negative controls respectively while those in groups C, D and E received 25, 50 and 100mg/kg body weight of the extract respectively in addition to specific requirements of the model. The extract contained alkaloids (4.20mg/g), flavonoids (13.60mg/g), phenolics (1.50mg/g) and saponins (3.10mg/g) while tannins, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides and steroids were not detected. In the castor oil-induced diarrhoeal model, the onset time of diarrhoea was significantly prolonged by the 25 and 50mg/kg body weight whereas there was no episode in the 100mg/kg body weight treated animals. The extract (25 and 50mg/kg body weight) decreased the number, water content, fresh weight and total number of wet feaces and increased the inhibition of defecations. All the doses of the extract significantly increased the Na(+) -K(+) ATPase activity in the small intestine. The extract dose dependently decreased the masses and volume of intestinal fluid with corresponding increase in inhibition of intestinal fluid content in the castor oil-induced enteropooling model.

We observed that these short ncRNAs frequently cover the entire length of annotated snoRNAs or tRNAs, which suggests that other loci specifying similar ncRNAs can be identified by clusters of short RNA sequences. We combined publicly available datasets of tens of millions of short RNA sequence tags from Drosophila melanogaster, and mapped them to the Drosophila genome. Approximately 6 million perfectly mapping sequence tags were then assembled into 521,302 tag-contigs (TCs) based on tag overlap. Most transposon-derived sequences, exons and annotated miRNAs, tRNAs and snoRNAs are detected by TCs, which show distinct patterns of length and tag-depth for different categories. The typical length and tag-depth of snoRNA-derived TCs was used to predict 7 previously unrecognized box H/ACA and 26 box C/D snoRNA candidates.

In New Zealand, a commercial real-time PCR assay was introduced in 2007 to identify the DNA of this pathogen in preputial scrapings; however, concerns were raised about the specificity of the test following anecdotal reports of a high number of test-positive bulls with no apparent relationship to reproductive performance. The objective of this study, therefore, was to examine the association between real-time PCR assay results from beef breeding bulls and pregnancy rates in beef herds using these bulls. Veterinarians from four veterinary practices selected beef cattle herds with relatively high and low pregnancy rates between December 2008 and February 2009.

The study was performed in two cell lines: Skv human keratinocytes containing multiple integrated copies of HPV16 derived from bowenoid papulosis, and murine L1 lung sarcoma cells of Balb/c mice. The murine model of cutaneous angiogenesis was used to assess and count the new blood vessel formation. The mice were immunosuppressed by a total body X-ray irradiation and treated with 5% or 2.5% imiquimod cream before or after induction of angiogenesis with intradermally injected tumor cell suspension. In some experiments the mice were, in addition, treated intraperitoneally with monoclonal antibodies against murine IFNalpha, TNFgamma or IL-18. Topical application of imiquimod on the murine skin resulted in reduction of angiogenesis (P < 0.001) induced by intradermal injection of both human and mouse tumor cells, more pronounced when 5% cream was applied on three consecutive days. Antibodies against murine IFNgamma, TNFalpha and IL-18 completely abolished the inhibitory effect of imiquimod on angiogenesis induced by murine L1 sacroma cells. When human Skv cells were used in angiogenesis assay, the effect of imiquimod was abolished by antibodies against IL-18 but not against TNFalpha, which may be due to overproduction of TNFalpha by Skv cells.",
    "response": "Antiangiogenic effect of imiquimod was found to be mediated by IL-18, probably through promoting production of INFgamma, the most important inhibitor of angiogenesis.",

    "instruction": "Is hIV-1 Vif N-terminal motif required for recruitment of Cul5 to suppress APOBEC3?",
    "context": "HIV-1 Vif promotes the degradation of host anti-retroviral factor family, APOBEC3 proteins via the recruitment of a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The complex is composed of a scaffold protein, Cullin 5 (Cul5), RING-box protein (Rbx), a SOCS box binding protein complex, Elongins B/C (Elo B/C), as well as newly identified host co-factor, core binding factor beta (CBF-β). Cul5 has previously been shown to bind amino acids within an HCCH domain as well as a PPLP motif at the C-terminus of Vif; however, it is unclear whether Cul5 binding requires additional regions of the Vif polypeptide. Here, we provide evidence that an amino terminal region of full length Vif is necessary for the Vif-Cul5 interaction. Single alanine replacement of select amino acids spanning residues 25-30 (25VXHXMY30) reduced the ability for Vif to bind Cul5, but not CBF-β or Elo B/C in pull-down experiments. In addition, recombinant Vif mutants had a reduced binding affinity for Cul5 compared to wild-type as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. N-terminal mutants that demonstrated reduced Cul5 binding were also unable to degrade APOBEC3G as well as APOBEC3F and were unable to restore HIV infectivity, in the presence of APOBEC3G. Although the Vif N-terminal amino acids were necessary for Cul5 interaction, the mutation of each residue to alanine induced a change in the secondary structure of the Vif-CBF-β-Elo B/C complex as suggested by results from circular dichroism spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography experiments. Surprisingly, the replacement of His108 to alanine also contributed to the Vif structure. Thus, it is unclear whether the amino acids contribute to a direct interaction with Cul5 or whether the amino acids are responsible for the structural organization of the Vif protein that promotes Cul5 binding.",
    "response": "Taken together, we propose a novel Vif N-terminal motif that is responsible for Vif recruitment of Cul5. Motifs in Vif that are absent from cellular proteins represent attractive targets for future HIV pharmaceutical design.",

    "context": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure in the U.S., but the pathophysiology is incompletely understood. Despite evidence for apoptotic signaling, hepatic cell death after APAP is generally considered necrotic in mice and in humans. Recent findings suggest that the receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) acts as a switch from apoptosis to necrosis (programmed necrosis). Thus, the aim of the current investigation was to determine if RIP3 is involved in APAP-induced liver cell death. APAP (200-300 mg/kg) caused glutathione depletion and protein adduct formation, oxidant stress, mitochondrial release of apoptosis inducing factor, and nuclear DNA fragmentation resulting in centrilobular necrosis in C57Bl/6J mice. Inhibiting RIP3 protein induction with antisense morpholinos in wild-type animals or using RIP3-deficient mice had no effect on protein adduct formation but attenuated all other parameters, including necrotic cell death, at 6 hours after APAP. In addition, cultured hepatocytes from RIP3-deficient mice showed reduced injury compared to wild-type cells after 24 hours. Interestingly, APAP-induced mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), the initiator of mitochondrial fission, was inhibited by reduced RIP3 protein expression and the Drp1 inhibitor MDIVI reduced APAP-induced cell death at 24 hours. All of these protective effects were lost after 24 hours in vivo or 48 hours in vitro.",
    "response": "RIP3 is an early mediator of APAP hepatotoxicity, involving modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidant stress.

Detrusor tissue was obtained from patients who had undergone cystectomy for bladder cancer and strips of intact or mucosa-denuded muscle were set up for force measurement. Preparations were precontracted with KCl, carbachol or electric-field stimulation (EFS). Precontracted strips were relaxed using increasing concentrations of catecholamines in the absence and presence of the subtype-selective β-adrenoceptor (AR) blockers CGP 20712A (β1-ARs), ICI 118,551 (β2-ARs), and L-748,337 (β3-ARs). Force development in response to KCl (40 mM), carbachol (1 μM) or EFS was larger in the absence of mucosa than in intact muscle strips. The force of contraction of mucosa-denuded strips with detached urothelium incubated in the same chamber was as low as in intact strips. Noradrenaline relaxed precontracted detrusor strips to a significantly larger extent and at lower concentrations in denuded than in intact strips. CGP 20712A did not affect noradrenaline-induced relaxation of denuded and intact strips, and ICI 118,551 did not influence noradrenaline-induced relaxation in denuded strips, but abolished the difference between denuded and intact strips.

    "context": "Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a cytokine of the interleukin-6 superfamily which is up-regulated in cardiac diseases, in part via hypoxia-dependent mechanisms. However, no evidence for a direct regulation of CT-1 gene (CTF1) promoter by hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been provided. Hypoxia increased CT-1 mRNA levels in the murine adult cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, in a murine model (C57BL/6), we show that systemic hypoxia also significantly up-regulated CT-1 in myocardial tissue. The effect of hypoxia on CT-1 expression was mediated through a transcriptional mechanism, since hypoxia increased luciferase activity of constructs containing CTF1 promoter sequences. The increase in CT-1 levels was significantly reduced by drugs that prevent calcium mobilization, such as lercanidipine, or that inhibit the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (wortmannin) or mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin). The CT-1 elevation was similarly induced by HIF-1α over-expression in co-transfection experiments and prevented by HIF-1α silencing. The direct interaction of HIF-1α with the CTF1 promoter was confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis of hypoxia response elements, electrophoreric mobility shift, and ChIP assays. Hypoxia induced HL-1 apoptosis (measured as annexin-V binding or caspase 3/7 activity) which was increased when CT-1 was silenced in knocked-down cells by lentiviral vectors.",

We investigated endonasal perfusion following postural change to determine predictors of vascular response. Optical rhinometry was performed in 52 healthy subjects (25 women) with an age range of 21-80 years. Subjects were placed in supine position after 5 min of standing. Optical density (OD) as marker of endonasal blood volume was continuously measured for 30 min after postural change. In addition to age, data on other risk factors for impaired vascular reactivity, such as gender, smoking, level of physical activity, resting heart rate and blood pressure were obtained. To evaluate raw-data curves, integrals over defined time-periods were calculated. The OD initially increased following the intervention (t(max) at 207 +/- 12 s, mean +/- SEM). Thereafter, a gradual return to baseline levels was observed in young but not in elderly subjects. In multivariate models, age was the most influential parameter for vascular response followed by body mass index. The defined integrals as indicators of curve structure were all significantly influenced by age (P < 0.01 for each interval). Other measured risk factors had no effect on curve characteristics.",

All patients with SBP had polymorphonuclear cell count in ascitic fluid > 250/mm(3). In patients with SB a thorough study did not reveal any other cause of bacteremia. The patients were followed-up for a 30-d period following diagnosis of the infection. The final outcome of the patients was recorded in the end of follow-up and comparison among 3 groups of patients according to the pattern of drug resistance was performed.

Human thyrocytes were incubated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in order to determine the effect on HUVEC NOS activity. HUVEC cGMP production over a 3-h period was measured as an indicator of NOS activity in the absence and presence of thyrocytes. To determine thyrocyte production of ADMA, samples of conditioned media were analysed by HPLC. The presence of primary human thyrocytes or immortalized human thyrocyte SGHTL-189 cells caused a significant inhibition of both basal (approximately 57% inhibition) and thrombin-stimulated (approximately 42% inhibition) HUVEC cGMP production. Both primary human thyrocytes and SGHTL-189 cells released ADMA (approximately 0. 28 microg per 10(6) thyrocytes over a 3-day period).

Cx43 localizes predominantly to gap junctions, but has also been detected at subsarcolemmal (SSM), but not interfibrillar (IFM), mitochondria, where it is considered important for cardioprotection. We have now examined the effect of FGF-2 administration to the heart on resistance to calcium-induced permeability transition (mPTP) of isolated SSM vs. IFM suspensions, in relation to mitochondrial PKCε/Cx43 levels, phosphorylation, and the presence of peptide Gap27, a Cx43 channel blocker. FGF-2 perfusion increased resistance to calcium-induced mPTP in SSM and IFM suspensions by 2.9- and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with their counterparts from vehicle-perfused hearts, assessed spectrophotometrically as cyclosporine A-inhibitable swelling. The salutary effect of FGF-2 was lost in SSM, but not in IFM, in the presence of Gap27. FGF-2 perfusion increased relative levels of PKCε, phospho(p) PKCε, and Tom-20 translocase in SSM and IFM, and of Cx43 in SSM. Phospho-serine (pS) 262- and pS368-Cx43 showed a 30- and 8-fold increase, respectively, in SSM from FGF-2-treated, compared with untreated, hearts. Stimulation of control SSM with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, increased both calcium tolerance and mitochondrial Cx43 phosphorylation at S262 and S368.

As ANG II counteracts most of the ANF biological effects, the aim of the present study was to evaluate ANG II effects on renal DA metabolism and identify the receptor involved. To determine ANG II effects on renal DA metabolism, we evaluated (3)H-DA uptake in vitro in kidney tissue samples from Sprague-Dawley rats. The results indicate that ANG II decreased DA uptake at 30 min, in a concentration-response fashion, in the external and juxtamedullar cortex. DA uptake was characterized as an extraneuronal uptake and decreased at 0 degrees C and in sodium-free medium. The biological receptor type involved was AT(1), since losartan reversed ANG II effects on DA uptake while AT(2) receptors were not involved since PD 123319 did not affect ANG II effects.

While previous studies in the bladder have demonstrated alterations in caveolae with particular physiologic or pathologic conditions, little attention has been focused on the functional significance of these organelles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of caveolae in the modulation of receptor-mediated signal transduction and determine the presence and localization of caveolin proteins in bladder tissue. Contractile responses to physiologic agonists were measured in rat bladder tissue before and after disruption of caveolae achieved by depleting membrane cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Stimulation with agonists was repeated after caveolae were restored as a result of cholesterol replenishment. RT-PCR, immmunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were used to determine the expression and localization of caveolin mRNA and proteins. Following caveolae disruption, contractile responses to angiotensin II and serotonin were attenuated, whereas responses to bradykinin and phenylephrine were augmented. Cholesterol replenishment restored responses towards baseline. Carbachol and KCl induced contractions were not affected by caveolae disruption. Ultrastructure analysis confirmed loss of caveolae following cholesterol depletion with cyclodextrin and caveolae restoration following cholesterol replacement. Gene and protein expression of caveolin-1, -2, and -3 was detected in bladder tissue. Immunoreactivity for all three caveolins was observed in smooth muscle cells throughout the bladder.",

Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive method of detecting in vivo diffuse axonal injury (DAI), where a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water reflects cytotoxic edema. We use DW-MRI to assess severe DAI in rats treated with a single acute postinjury injection of PEG. Rats were divided into uninjured, injured saline-treated, and injured PEG-treated groups. Injury groups received a severe brain injury using an impact-acceleration weight-drop model. Saline or PEG was administered acutely as a single intravenous dose to injured saline-treated and injured PEG-treated groups, respectively. DW-MRI analysis was performed at postinjury day 7 with a 9.4-T magnet. ADC was calculated for cortex, corpus callosum/hippocampus, and thalamus in each group. An expected decrease in ADC, representing cytotoxic edema, was observed in the injured saline-treated group. The injured PEG-treated group demonstrated no decrease in ADC relative to the uninjured rats, and the difference between ADC in saline and PEG-treated groups reached significance for all 3 zones of assessed brain. Differences were seen grossly between injured saline-treated and injured PEG-treated groups on representative color-mapped ADC images.",
    "response": "A single intravenous dose of PEG dramatically limits sequelae of severe acceleration-induced brain injury--in this case, assessed by cytotoxic edema on DW-MRI--by intervening at the primary injury level of neuronal membrane disruption. This outcome is unprecedented, as no prior treatments for DAI have demonstrated similar efficacy. DAI treatment with intravenous PEG may have future clinical relevance and warrants further investigation.",

    "context": "To determine whether standing orders for influenza vaccine increase its usage in an ambulatory setting in elderly patients. Retrospective analysis of influenza vaccine usage over 4 years (1999-2002). University ambulatory setting. Overall, 912 elderly patients of two physicians who issued standing orders and 884 elderly patients of two physicians who did not do so constituted the study group. Physicians were categorized as to whether they issued a verbal or written standing order to their nurses to administer the influenza vaccine to patients aged 65 and older. Rates of influenza vaccination of patients whose physicians used standing orders were compared with those of physicians who did not use standing orders. Five hundred seventy-six (63%) patients of physicians who used standing orders received influenza vaccine, compared with 332 (38%) patients of physicians who did not use them (P<.001). Standing orders accounted for a significantly higher rate of influenza vaccination in each study year. Moreover, in 2001, when influenza vaccine delivery was delayed, physicians who used standing orders maintained their same rate of usage, but physicians who did not had rates of about one-half their usage of the other 3 years.",

    "instruction": "Does itraconazole greatly increase plasma concentrations and effects of felodipine?",
    "context": "Felodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Itraconazole strongly interacts with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., terfenadine, triazolam and lovastatin); hence it is important to uncover the possible interaction of itraconazole with felodipine. A double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover design was used to investigate the interaction between felodipine and itraconazole. Nine healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each ingested a single 5 mg oral dose of felodipine. Plasma concentrations of felodipine and itraconazole were determined and systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were measured up to 32 hours. On average, itraconazole increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of felodipine nearly eightfold (p < 0.001), the areas under the felodipine concentration-time curve [AUC(0-32) and AUC(0-infinity)] about sixfold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life twofold (p < 0.05). In seven of the nine subjects, even the Cmax of felodipine was lower without itraconazole than the 32-hour concentrations during the itraconazole phase. The decreases in blood pressure and the increases in heart rate were significantly greater during the itraconazole phase than during the placebo phase.",
    "response": "Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations and effects of oral felodipine. The inhibition of CYP3A4 during the first-pass and elimination phases of felodipine seems to be the mechanism of the observed interaction. The concomitant use of itraconazole and some other azole antifungals with felodipine and other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should be avoided or their doses should be reduced accordingly.",

    "context": "Cancer immunotherapy refers to an array of strategies intended to treat progressive tumors by augmenting a patient's anti-tumor immune response. As immunotherapy is eventually incorporated into oncology treatment paradigms, it is important to understand how these therapies interact with established cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or Radiotherapy (RT). To address this, we utilized a well-established, autochthonous murine model of prostate cancer to test whether RT could augment (or diminish) the CD4 T cell response to a tumor vaccine. Transgenic mice that develop spontaneous prostate cancer (TRAMP) which also express a unique tumor associated antigen (Influenza hemagglutinin) under the control of a prostate-specific promoter were given local RT in combination with immunotherapy. The immunological outcome of this combinatorial strategy was assayed by monitoring the effector response of adoptively transferred, prostate-specific CD4 T cells. Neither RT nor immunotherapy alone was capable of priming an anti-tumor immune response in animals with evolving tumors. The combination of immunotherapy with RT resulted in anti-tumor T cell activation--this effect was profoundly dependent on the relative timing of RT and immunotherapy. Anti-tumor immune responses occurred when immunotherapy was administered 3-5 weeks post-RT, but such responses were undetectable when immunotherapy was administered either earlier (peri-radiotherapy) or later.",
    "response": "The therapeutic temporal window of immunotherapy post-RT suggests that highly aggressive, immuno-suppressive tumors might be most sensitive to immunotherapy in a fairly narrow time window; these results should help to guide future development of clinical combinatorial strategies.",

Although the effect of work hour limitations on operative volume has been examined, no study has examined whether duty hour reform has had an effect on operative volume variability. The ACGME operative log data of graduating general surgery residents from 1992 to 2015 were examined. Residents with the most and fewest total major cases were identified and case logs, learning styles, and evaluations were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using linear regression analysis, chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. One hundred and thirty-five residents graduated from 1992 to 2015. No change in overall operative volume was seen after the 2003 duty hour reform, however, there was an increase in operative variability. In addition, there was an increase in the variability of total major cases between the resident completing the most and fewest cases per class (183.3; p = 0.02) after the start of work hour restrictions.

Self-sampling (SS) for HPV is effective for increasing coverage in screening programs, but requires expensive commercial sampling kits. We aimed to evaluate if vaginal SS, without commercial preservatives was adequate for HPV testing. Women with abnormal cervical smears as determined from the organized screening program were invited to a colposcopy clinic. The 121 women were asked to insert a cotton swab into the vagina and rotate it, put the cotton swab into a sterile cryotube, break the upper part of the stick and put the cap on. Thereafter, the gynaecologist collected a liquid based cytology (LBC) sample. The presence of HPV-types in SS and LBC samples was analysed with PCR and luminex-based typing.

We have written a program, GapCoder to automate this procedure. The program can input PIR format aligned datasets, find the indels and add the indel-based characters. The output is a NEXUS format file, which includes a table showing what region each indel characters is based on. If regions are excluded from analysis, this table makes it easy to identify the corresponding indel characters for exclusion.",

Elastinolytic cathepsin S (Cat S) is highly expressed in human aneurysmal lesions, but whether it contributes to the pathogenesis of AAA remains unknown. AAAs were induced in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and Cat S compound mutant (Apoe(-/-)Ctss(-/-)) mice and in ApoE-deficient Cat S wild-type littermates (Apoe(-/-)Ctss(+/+)) by chronic angiotensin II infusion, and AAA lesions were analysed after 28 days. We found that Cat S expression increased significantly in mouse AAA lesions. The AAA incidence in Apoe(-/-)Ctss(-/-) mice was much lower than that in Apoe(-/-)Ctss(+/+) mice (10 vs. 80%). Cat S deficiency significantly reduced external and luminal abdominal aortic diameters, medial elastin fragmentation, and adventitia collagen content. Cat S deficiency reduced aortic lesion expression and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and Cat K, but not the activity of other major cathepsins, such as Cat B and Cat L. Absence of Cat S significantly reduced AAA lesion media smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis, lesion adventitia microvessel content, and inflammatory cell accumulation and proliferation. In vitro studies proved that Cat S helps promote SMC apoptosis, angiogenesis, monocyte and T-cell transmigration, and T-cell proliferation--all of which are essential to AAA pathogenesis.",

    "instruction": "Does autophagy in oncogenic K-Ras promote basal extrusion of epithelial cells by degrading S1P?",
    "context": "To maintain a protective barrier, epithelia extrude cells destined to die by contracting a band of actin and myosin. Although extrusion can remove cells triggered to die by apoptotic stimuli, to maintain constant cell numbers, epithelia extrude live cells, which later die by anoikis. Because transformed cells may override anoikis and survive after extrusion, the direction of extrusion has important consequences for the extruded cell's fate. As most cells extrude apically, they are typically eliminated through the lumen; however, cells with upregulated survival signals that extrude basally could potentially invade the underlying tissue and migrate to other sites in the body. We found that oncogenic K-Ras cells predominantly extrude basally, rather than apically, in a cell-autonomous manner and can survive and proliferate after extrusion. Expression of K-Ras(V12) downregulates the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1P2, both of which are required for apical extrusion. Surprisingly, the S1P biosynthetic pathway is not affected because the S1P precursor, sphingosine kinase, and the degradative enzymes S1P lyase and S1PP phosphatase are not significantly altered. Instead, we found that high levels of autophagy in extruding Ras(V12) cells leads to S1P degradation. Disruption of autophagy chemically or genetically in K-Ras(V12) cells rescues S1P localization and apical extrusion.",
    "response": "Oncogenic K-Ras cells downregulate both S1P and its receptor S1P2 to promote basal extrusion. Because live basally extruding cells can survive and proliferate after extrusion, we propose that basal cell extrusion provides a novel mechanism for cells to exit the epithelium and initiate invasion into the surrounding tissues.",

    "instruction": "Does d-serine in the midbrain periaqueductal gray contribute to morphine tolerance in rats?",
    "context": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor plays a critical role in morphine tolerance. D-serine, a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, participates in many physiological and pathophysiological processes via regulating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. The purinergic P2X7 receptor activation can induce the D-serine release in the central nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the role of the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray D-serine in the mechanism of morphine tolerance in rats. The development of morphine tolerance was induced in normal adult male Sprague-Dawley rats through subcutaneous injection of morphine (10 mg/kg). The analgesic effect of morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was assessed by measuring mechanical withdrawal thresholds in rats with an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. The D-serine concentration and serine racemase expression levels in the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray were evaluated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. The effects of intra-ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray injections of the D-serine degrading enzyme D-amino acid oxidase and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting the P2X7 receptor on chronic morphine-treated rats were also explored. We found that repeated morphine administrations decreased the antinociceptive potency of morphine evidenced by the percent changes in mechanical pain threshold in rats. By contrast, the D-serine contents and the expression levels of the serine racemase protein were upregulated in the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray in morphine-tolerant rats. The development of morphine tolerance was markedly alleviated by intra-ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray injections of D-amino acid oxidase or antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting the P2X7 receptor.",
    "response": "Our data indicate that the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine is partially mediated by ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray D-serine content, and the activation of the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray P2X7 receptor is an essential prelude to D-serine release. These results suggest that a cascade involving P2X7 receptor-D-serine-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediated signaling pathway in the supraspinal mechanism of morphine tolerance.",

    "context": "Clinically, a good deal of injury from stroke results from ischemic-reperfusion. There is a loss of cerebral parenchyma and its associated cells, disruption of neuronal connections, compromise of the blood-brain barrier, and inflammation. We tested whether exogenously engrafted human neural stem cells could migrate rapidly and extensively to damaged regions, following transplantation into a neurogenic site where migration cues are already underway during stroke onset, then counteract a number of these pathological processes. One day post-injury, we injected human neural stem cells (hNSCs) into the ipsilesional hippocampus of a mouse model of stroke with middle cerebral artery occlusion to induce focal ischemia followed by reperfusion (MCAO/R). The time frame for hNSC transplantation corresponded to upregulation of endogenous proinflammatory cytokines. We examined the effect of hNSC transplantation on pathological processes and behavioral dysfunction 48 hours post-injury. Twenty-four hours after transplantation, engrafted hNSCs had migrated extensively to the lesion, and infarct volume was reduced relative to MCAO/R controls. The behavioral deficits seen in MCAO/R controls were also significantly improved. Given this rapid response, we hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying therapeutic activity were anti-inflammatory rather than due to cell replacement. In support of this idea, in hNSC-transplanted mice we observed reduced microglial activation, decreased expression of proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α) and adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and amelioration of blood-brain barrier damage.",

    "context": "Seventy-eight pregnant women at term, scheduled for elective cesarean section, were enrolled in this multicenter trial to compare the analgesic efficacy and side effect profile of a spinal block with hyperbaric bupivacaine alone (Group B) or combined with 75 microg of clonidine (Group BC) or with clonidine 75 microg and fentanyl 12.5 microg (Group BCF). Intraoperatively, clonidine increased the spread of the sensory block and decreased pain (pain scores 23+/-7 mm vs 17+/-6 and 2+/-1 mm for Group B versus Groups BC and BCF; P < 0.05) and analgesic supplementation. This improved analgesia was best with the clonidine-fentanyl combination (Group BC versus Group BCF; P < 0.05). Postoperative analgesia was prolonged only in Group BCF (215+/-79 min vs 137+/-35 and 183+/-80 min for Group BCF versus Groups B and BC; P < 0.05). Blood pressure and heart rate changes were not significantly different among groups, whereas sedation and pruritus were significantly more frequent in Group BCF. Nausea and vomiting were decreased in Groups BC and BCF. Apgar scores and umbilical artery blood pH were not different among groups.

    "instruction": "Does inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase prevent alterations in medial prefrontal cortex excitability induced by repeated cocaine administration?",
    "context": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a forebrain region that regulates cognitive function and reward-motivated behaviors, has been implicated in the neuropathological mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. In cocaine-abstinent human addicts, neuronal activity of the mPFC is increased in response to cocaine re-exposure or drug-associated cues. Additionally, repeated cocaine exposure alters the membrane properties and ion channel function of mPFC pyramidal neurons in drug-withdrawn rats, leading to an increased firing in response to excitatory stimuli. Nitric oxide (NO), a diffusible neuromodulator of neuronal excitability, may play a role in initiating and maintaining behavioral effects of psychostimulants. However, the role of NO in the mechanisms by which cocaine affects membrane excitability is not well clarified. In this study, we attempted to determine whether inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) altered the changes induced by repeated cocaine exposure and withdrawal. Visualized whole-cell current clamp recordings in brain slices containing the mPFC of rats administered (once per day for 5 days) with either vehicle (10% Cremophor EL in saline 0.9%), cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.), or cocaine and the nNOS inhibitor 7-NI (50 mg/kg, i.p.) were employed. We found that nNOS inhibition prevented cocaine sensitization and the increased membrane excitability of pyramidal cells, evidenced by an increased number of evoked spikes and reductions in inward rectification observed after short-term withdrawal from cocaine.",

    "instruction": "Does liver iron modulate hepcidin expression during chronically elevated erythropoiesis in mice?",
    "context": "The liver-derived peptide hepcidin controls the balance between iron demand and iron supply. By inhibiting the iron export activity of ferroportin, hepcidin modulates iron absorption and delivery from the body's stores. The regulation of hepcidin, however, is not completely understood and includes a variety of different signals. We studied iron metabolism and hepcidin expression in mice constitutively overexpressing erythropoietin (Epo) (Tg6 mice), which leads to excessive erythropoiesis. We observed a very strong down-regulation of hepcidin in Tg6 mice that was accompanied by a strong increase in duodenal expression of ferroportin and divalent metal tranporter-1, as well as enhanced duodenal iron absorption. Despite these compensatory mechanisms, Tg6 mice displayed marked circulating iron deficiency and low levels of iron in liver, spleen, and muscle. To elucidate the primary signal affecting hepcidin expression during chronically elevated erythropoiesis, we increased iron availability by either providing iron (thus further increasing the hematocrit) or reducing erythropoiesis-dependent iron consumption by means of splenectomy. Both treatments increased liver iron and up-regulated hepcidin expression and the BMP6/SMAD pathway despite continuously high plasma Epo levels and sustained erythropoiesis. This suggests that hepcidin expression is not controlled by erythropoietic signals directly in this setting. Rather, these results indicate that iron consumption for erythropoiesis modulates liver iron content, and ultimately BMP6 and hepcidin. Analysis of the BMP6/SMAD pathway targets showed that inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) and SMAD7, but not transmembrane serine protease 6 (TMPRSS6), were up-regulated by increased iron availability and thus may be involved in setting the upper limit of hepcidin.",

    "context": "Psychiatric illness and anxiety disorders have strong neurodevelopmental components. Environmental insults such as prenatal exposure to stress and genetic differences in stress responses may affect brain development. A rat model of random variable prenatal stress was used to study the expression and processing of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the offspring of the stressed rat dams. To account for unknown genetic influences that may play a role in the outcome of this prenatal stress paradigm, three different rat strains with known differences in stress responsivity were studied: Fischer, Sprague-Dawley, and Lewis rats (n=132). Multiple disparities in mRNA expression levels of BDNF, and transcripts related to its processing and signaling were found in the three strains. Of the numerous splice variants transcribed from the BDNF gene, the transcript containing BDNF exon VI was most aberrant in the prenatally stressed animals. Protein levels of both uncleaved proBDNF and mature BDNF were also altered, as was intra-cellular signaling by phosphorylation of the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2, TrkB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk 1/2). Changes were not only dependent on prenatal stress, but were also strain dependent, demonstrating the importance of genetic background.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this model in a main OR suite setting with typical mixed inpatient/outpatient cases. We conducted a retrospective matched-pair cohort study of 133 upper extremity surgery patients treated in the swing room model under ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade. We compared this cohort with case-matched historical controls treated in the traditional single OR model under general anesthesia. The primary endpoint was non-operative time, defined as the interval between skin closure and incision in the following case. Secondary endpoints included throughput estimated as the median number of cases per eight-hour day, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) bypass rates, and postoperative pain/nausea and vomiting (PONV) intervention rates.

Emerging evidence suggests the major subtypes--adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC)--respond differently to therapy. Identification of the molecular differences between these tumor types will have a significant impact in designing novel therapies that can improve the treatment outcome. We used an integrative genomics approach, combing high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression microarray profiles, to compare AC and SqCC tumors in order to uncover alterations at the DNA level, with corresponding gene transcription changes, which are selected for during development of lung cancer subtypes. Through the analysis of multiple independent cohorts of clinical tumor samples (>330), normal lung tissues and bronchial epithelial cells obtained by bronchial brushing in smokers without lung cancer, we identified the overexpression of BRF2, a gene on Chromosome 8p12, which is specific for development of SqCC of lung. Genetic activation of BRF2, which encodes a RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription initiation factor, was found to be associated with increased expression of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that are involved in processes essential for cell growth, such as RNA splicing. Ectopic expression of BRF2 in human bronchial epithelial cells induced a transformed phenotype and demonstrates downstream oncogenic effects, whereas RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown suppressed growth and colony formation of SqCC cells overexpressing BRF2, but not AC cells. Frequent activation of BRF2 in >35% preinvasive bronchial carcinoma in situ, as well as in dysplastic lesions, provides evidence that BRF2 expression is an early event in cancer development of this cell lineage.",

Selected gene regions were also sequenced in healthy, unrelated ethnically matched control subjects, consisting of 84 African American, 96 Caucasian, and 95 Hispanic subjects. The majority (70%) of the A-beta- KPD patients had no significant causal polymorphisms in either the proximal promoter or coding regions of the seven genes. The combination of six potentially significant low-frequency, heterozygous sequence variants in HNF-1 alpha (A174V or G574S), PDX1 (putative 5'-untranslated region CCAAT box, P33T, or P239Q), or PAX4 (R133W) were found in 27% (10/37) of patients, with one additional patient revealing two variants, PDX1 P33T and PAX4 R133W. The A174V variant has not been previously reported.",
    "response": "Despite its well-circumscribed, robust, and distinctive phenotype of severe, nonautoimmune-mediated beta-cell dysfunction, A-beta- KPD is most likely not a predominantly monogenic diabetic syndrome.

    "context": "This study had 2 aims: to determine whether arthroscopic partial meniscectomy improved symptoms in patients with a torn meniscus and severe degenerative change and to determine whether meniscectomy hastened the symptomatic progression of osteoarthritis in these patients. An outcome study. The study group consisted of 126 patients with Outerbridge grade IV degeneration (exposed bone) in the same compartment as a meniscal tear. These patients underwent arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. The control group consisted of 13 patients with exposed bone in the tibiofemoral compartment but intact menisci. They underwent washout. Data were obtained from a database of over 3,000 consecutive arthroscopies, patient medical records, and patients directly. Outcome was assessed a minimum of 12 months after surgery. Meniscectomy improved symptoms initially in 82 cases (65%). At a median of 52 months after meniscectomy, 41 patients (32%) had undergone further surgery (39 total knee arthroplasty, 1 unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and 1 tibial osteotomy). Fifty patients (40%) reported subjective improvement. The subjective outcome assessment by patients was consistent with patient activity, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the Lysholm score. Meniscectomy did not hasten the progression of osteoarthritis because more patients required joint replacement after washout (P =.04), and the mean time to further surgery was greater for meniscectomy than for washout (74 months [standard error, 4.11] and 50 months [standard error, 12.3], respectively, P =.067).",
    "response": "Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in the presence of Outerbridge grade IV degenerative change is likely to improve symptoms initially in patients with symptomatic meniscal tears and may provide lasting benefit.

    "context": "Body mass index (BMI) and mental stress seem to exert part of their cardiovascular risk by eliciting inflammation. However, the adverse effects of stress on inflammatory activity with BMI are not fully understood. We investigated whether higher BMI is associated with reduced glucocorticoid inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production following stress in men while controlling for age and blood pressure. We measured glucocorticoid inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated release of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Forty-two men (age range 21-65 years; BMI range 21-34 kg/m(2)) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (combination of mock job interview and mental arithmetic task). Whole blood samples were taken immediately before and after stress, and during recovery up to 60 min post-stress. Glucocorticoid sensitivity of LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha expression was assessed in vitro with and without coincubating increasing doses of dexamethasone. Moreover, salivary cortisol was measured during the experiment and on a normal day for assessment of baseline circadian cortisol. Higher BMI was associated with lower glucocorticoid sensitivity of monocyte TNF-alpha production after stress (main effect of BMI: p<0.001) and with more pronounced decreases of glucocorticoid sensitivity following stress (interaction of stress-by-BMI: p=0.002). Neither LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha release nor baseline glucocorticoid sensitivity were associated with BMI. Similarly, BMI was not associated with salivary cortisol, either in reaction to stress or in circadian cortisol secretion.",

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs. Eighteen studies (two RCTs and 16 observational studies) in 5,552 patients were included. Pooled analysis suggested that single-dose etomidate was not associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis in both the RCTs (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84-1.72; P = .31; I(2) = 0%) and the observational studies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-1.13; P = .23; I(2) = 25%).

    "context": "Unstable atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries require surgical endarterectomy to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. We aimed to identify microRNAs that exert a broad effect on atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability in the carotid artery. We made a selection of 164 genes involved in atherosclerosis. Using www.targetscan.org, we determined which microRNAs potentially regulate expression of these genes. We identified multiple microRNAs from the 14q32 microRNA cluster, which is highly involved in vascular remodeling. In human plaques, collected during carotid endarterectomy surgery, we found that 14q32 microRNA (miR-494) was abundantly expressed in unstable lesions. We induced atherosclerotic plaque formation in hypercholesterolemic ApoE mice by placing semiconstrictive collars around both carotid arteries. We injected \"Gene Silencing Oligonucleotides\" against miR-494 (GSO-494) or negative control (GSO-control). Using fluorescently labeled GSOs, we confirmed uptake of GSOs in affected areas of the carotids, but not elsewhere in the vasculature. After injection of GSO-494, we observed significant downregulation of miR-494 expression in the carotid arteries, although miR-494 target genes were upregulated. Further analyses revealed a 65% decrease in plaque size after GSO-494 treatment. Plaque stability was increased in GSO-494-treated mice, determined by an 80% decrease in necrotic core size and a 50% increase in plaque collagen content. Inhibition of miR-494 also resulted in decreased cholesterol levels and decreased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fractions.",

    "context": "Akt activation is involved in the pathogenesis of inherited thyroid cancer in Cowden's syndrome and in sporadic thyroid cancers. In cell culture, Akt regulates thyroid cell growth and survival; but recent data suggest that Akt also regulates cell motility in non-thyroid cell lines. We therefore sought to evaluate the role of Akt in thyroid cancer progression. We evaluated 46 thyroid cancer, 20 thyroid follicular adenoma, and adjacent normal tissues samples by immunohistochemistry for activated Akt (pAkt), Akt 1, 2, and 3, and p27 expression. Immunoblots were performed in 14 samples. Akt activation was identified in 10/10 follicular cancers, 26/26 papillary cancers, and 2/10 follicular variant of papillary cancers, but in only 4/66 normal tissue samples and 2/10 typical benign follicular adenomas. Immunoactive pAkt was greatest in regions of capsular invasion; and was localised to the nucleus in follicular cancers and the cytoplasm in papillary cancers, except for invasive regions of papillary cancers where it localised to both compartments. Immunoactive Akt 1, but not Akt 2 or Akt 3, correlated with pAkt localisation, and nuclear pAkt was associated with cytoplasmic expression of p27. In vitro studies using human thyroid cancer cells demonstrated that nuclear translocation of Akt 1 and pAkt were associated with cytoplasmic p27 and cell invasion and migration. Cell migration and the localisation of Akt 1, pAkt, and p27 were inhibited by PI3 kinase, but not MEK inhibition.",

No reports are available as to whether ONOO- generates or modulates inflammatory mediator release from activated guinea pig lung mast cells. In this study, we explored the modulatory role of intracellular ONOO- on inflammatory mediator release (histamine and leukotrienes) from activated mast cells. Guinea pig lung mast cells were purified by the enzyme digestion, and by using the rough and discontinuous Percoll density gradients. Mast cells were sensitized with IgG1 (anti-ovalbumin) antibody and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). The intracellular ROS formation was determined by following the oxidative production of 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), and anti-nitrotyrosine antibody immunofluorescence. Histamine was assayed using a fluorometric analyzer, leukotrienes by radioimmunoassay, intracellular Ca2+ levels by confocal scanning microscopy, and PLA(2) activity using prelabeling of [3H]arachidonic acid. ROS detected by DCFH-DA weakly increased in mast cells activated with OVA (1.0 g/ml), and the ROS so generated was inhibited by ebselen (50 microM). However, the ROS detected by DHR increased 3-fold under the same conditions. Peroxynitrite scavengers sL-MT, DMTU, and inhibitor FeTPPS inhibited ROS formation but the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) only partially inhibited this formation. Dimethyl thiourea (DMTU) and seleno-L-methionine (sL-MT) inhibited the tyrosine nitration of cytosolic proteins, the release of histamine and leukotrienes, Ca2+ influx, and the PLA(2) activity evoked by mast cell activation.",

However, regulation of lipid storage and its role in ccRCC are incompletely understood. Transcriptional profiling of primary ccRCC samples revealed that expression of the LD coat protein gene PLIN2 was elevated in tumors and correlated with HIF2α, but not HIF1α, activation. HIF2α-dependent PLIN2 expression promoted lipid storage, proliferation, and viability in xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, lipid storage maintained integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is functionally and physically associated with LDs. Specifically, PLIN2-dependent lipid storage suppressed cytotoxic ER stress responses that otherwise result from elevated protein synthetic activity characteristic of ccRCC cells. Thus, in addition to promoting ccRCC proliferation and anabolic metabolism, HIF2α modulates lipid storage to sustain ER homeostasis, particularly under conditions of nutrient and oxygen limitation, thereby promoting tumor cell survival.",

In myoblasts and muscle satellite cells HO-1 improves survival, proliferation and production of proangiogenic growth factors. Induction of HO-1 in injured tissues facilitates neovascularization, the process impaired in diabetes. We aimed to examine whether conditioned media from the HO-1 overexpressing myoblast cell line can improve a blood-flow recovery in ischemic muscles of diabetic mice. Analysis of myogenic markers was performed at the mRNA level in primary muscle satellite cells, isolated by a pre-plate technique from diabetic db/db and normoglycemic wild-type mice, and then cultured under growth or differentiation conditions. Hind limb ischemia was performed by femoral artery ligation in db/db mice and blood recovery was monitored by laser Doppler measurements. Mice were treated with a single intramuscular injection of conditioned media harvested from wild-type C2C12 myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells stably transduced with HO-1 cDNA, or with unconditioned media. Expression of HO-1 was lower in muscle satellite cells isolated from muscles of diabetic db/db mice when compared to their wild-type counterparts, what was accompanied by increased levels of Myf5 or CXCR4, and decreased Mef2 or Pax7. Such cells also displayed diminished differentiation potential when cultured in vitro, as shown by less effective formation of myotubes and reduced expression of myogenic markers (myogenic differentiation antigen - myoD, myogenin and myosin). Blood flow recovery after induction of severe hind limb ischemia was delayed in db/db mice compared to that in normoglycemic individuals. To improve muscle regeneration after ischemia, conditioned media collected from differentiating C2C12 cells (control and HO-1 overexpressing) were injected into hind limbs of diabetic mice. Analysis of blood flow revealed that media from HO-1 overexpressing cells accelerated blood-flow recovery, while immunohistochemical staining assessment of vessel density in injected muscle confirmed increased angiogenesis. The effect might be mediated by stromal-cell derived factor-1α proangiogenic factor, as its secretion is elevated in HO-1 overexpressing cells.",

In multivariate linear regression analysis, age (standardized beta=0.084), male gender (standardized beta=-0.072), history of ischemic heart disease (standardized beta=-0.069), baseline sodium level (standardized beta=-0.435), and tolvaptan use (standardized beta=0.093) were independent determinants of changes in sodium level from day 1 to day 3. In-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher in the hypo-hypo group (23.7%) and hypo-normo group (9.7%) than the normo group (6.9%) (p<0.001). After adjustment for covariates, both hypo-normo (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08-0.93, p=0.038) and normo (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.88, p=0.022) groups showed significantly lower in-hospital mortality rates than the hypo-hypo group.",

    "context": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) at high frequency (>5 Hz) induces analgesic effects, probably by activating pain modulation systems. A new rTMS paradigm--theta burst stimulation (TBS)--consists of bursts of three pulses at 50 Hz repeated five times per second. Like high frequency rTMS, both intermittent and prolonged continuous TBS (iTBS and pcTBS) lead to a facilitation of cortical excitability. (1) to evaluate the analgesic effects of neuronavigated iTBS and pcTBS, comparing them with those of classical high frequency rTMS (10 Hz) over the left M1, (2) to elucidate the role of conditioned pain modulation (CPM) in the antinociceptive effect of rTMS and (3) to investigate possible correlations between analgesia and cortical excitability. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in four experimental sessions, carried out in a random order (iTBS, pcTBS, 10 Hz rTMS or sham). Cold pain threshold, CPM and cortical excitability measurements were carried out before and after rTMS. We found that the analgesic effects of 10 Hz rTMS and pcTBS were significantly superior to those of sham rTMS. Moreover, pcTBS was significantly more effective than 10 Hz rTMS (P = 0.026). Analgesia did not seem to be driven by changes in CPM or cortical excitability.",

    "context": "The humanized CD20 mono- clonal antibody, rituximab, has significant anti-tumor activity in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and induces depletion of B-cells in vivo. It was the objective of this study to define the contribution of the different mechanisms of action of rituximab on primary normal and malignant B-cells. Primary human B-lymphocytes and effector cell fractions were isolated from peripheral blood of normal donors using an immunomagnetic separation technique. Blood samples from 20 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were studied and the B-lymphoblastoid Daudi cell line was used as a control. B-cells were cultured in the presence or absence of rituximab adding a secondary hyper-crosslinking antibody, serum as source of complement or different effector cell fractions. The cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. In contrast to the B-lymphoblastoid Daudi cell line, the number of highly purified normal peripheral blood CD19+ cells was only minimally affected by rituximab in the presence of autologous serum. A significant reduction in the number of B-cells was observed when mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were added back. To identify the cell type which mediates this effect, CD3+ T-cells, CD56+ cells, and CD14+ monocytes were added to selected CD22+ B-cells. A marked B-cell decrease was only observed in the presence of CD56+ and CD14+ cells in an effector to target ratio of 10:1. The experiments with mononuclear cells from patients with CLL showed a B-cell reduction by rituximab, which was significantly enhanced following addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).",

    "context": "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in women with gynecological malignancy worldwide. Despite multiple new approaches to treatment, relapse remains almost inevitable in patients with advanced disease. The poor outcome of advanced ovarian cancer treated with conventional therapy stimulated the search for new strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy. Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have known activity in advanced ovarian cancer, the effect of combined therapy against EGFR and PARP in this population has not been reported. In the current study, we investigated the mechanisms of erlotinib used alone or in combination with olaparib (AZD2281), a potent inhibitor of PARP, in an EGFR-overexpressing ovarian tumor xenograft model. A2780 (EGFR-overexpressing, BRCA1/2 wild-type) cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, which were then randomly assigned to treatment with vehicle, erlotinib, AZD2281, or erlotinib + AZD2281, for up to 3 weeks. All mice were then sacrificed and tumor tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis and monodansylcadervarine staining (for analysis of autophagy). Erlotinib could slightly inhibit growth of A2780 tumor xenografts, and AZD2281 alone had similar effects on tumor growth. However, the combination treatment had a markedly enhanced antitumor effect. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with erlotinib could significantly reduce the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 and AKT in A2780 tumor tissue. Of interest, monodansylcadervarine staining showed that the autophagic effects were substantially enhanced when the agents were combined, which may be due to downregulation of apoptosis.",

A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass surgery (n = 9,862) between January 1995 and December 2004 at the Texas Heart Institute was performed. Diabetic (n = 3,374) and nondiabetic patients (n = 6,488) were classified into five groups, according to their body mass index: normal weight (n = 2,148), overweight (n = 4,257), mild obesity (n = 2,298), moderate obesity (n = 785), or morbid obesity (n = 338). Multivariate, stepwise logistic regression was performed controlling for patient demographics, medical history, and preoperative medications to determine whether obesity was independently associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative outcomes.

We analyzed the in vivo role of RelA/p65, a component of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB, in different cell types during development of CP in mice. RelA/p65 was functionally inactivated in the pancreas (relaΔpanc), in myeloid cells (relaΔmye), or both (relaΔpanc,Δmye) compartments using the Cre-loxP strategy. Experimental CP was induced with repetitive injections of cerulein over 6 weeks. Pancreata were investigated histologically and biochemically. We created an in vitro coculture assay of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) and macrophages and performed gene arrays from pancreata and macrophages with functionally inactivated RelA/p65. Tissue samples from patients with CP were analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 expression. In contrast to their relaF/F littermates, relaΔpanc displayed typical signs of CP after long-term stimulation with cerulein. Numerous macrophages and activated α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive PSCs were detected. Additional inactivation of RelA/p65 in myeloid cells (relaΔpanc,Δmye) attenuated fibrosis. In vitro, RelA/p65-deficient, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages degraded fibronectin in cocultured PSCs. Using gene expression analysis, MMP-10 was identified as a candidate for this process. Recombinant MMP-10 degraded fibronectin in LPS-stimulated PSCs.

Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is a specific receptor for the natural anticoagulant activated protein C (APC). It mediates the cytoprotective properties of APC and is expressed in rheumatoid synovial tissue. A recent report shows that group V secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA₂V) prevents APC from binding to EPCR in endothelium and inhibits EPCR/APC function. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and function of EPCR on RASFs. Human synovial fibroblasts (SFs) were isolated from RA or osteoarthritis (OA) synovial tissues and treated with control, EPCR, or sPLA₂V small interfering RNA (siRNA); recombinant human APC, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), or sPLA₂V. RASF viability and migration/invasion were measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and collagen gel migration/invasion assays, respectively, and cartilage degradation by 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay in the presence of human OA articular cartilage explants. The expression or activation of cytokines, EPCR, cadherin-11, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) or both were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, or immunostaining. EPCR was expressed by both OASFs and RASFs but was markedly increased in RASFs. When EPCR was suppressed by siRNA or blocking antibody cell viability, cell invasion and cartilage degradation were reduced by more than 30%. Inflammatory mediators interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), cadherin-11, and NF-κB were significantly reduced by EPCR suppression under control or TNF-α-stimulated conditions. The expression or activation (or both) of MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK were also markedly decreased in cells transfected with EPCR siRNA. Further analysis revealed that sPLA₂V co-localized with EPCR on RASFs. Suppression of sPLA₂V reduced cell viability and cartilage degradation and increased APC binding to RASFs. Conversely, recombinant sPLA₂V increased cartilage degradation, blocked APC binding to RASFs, and could not rescue the effects induced by EPCR suppression.",

Its global prevalence has attained epidemic levels and treatment options that reach beyond temporary relief of symptoms are urgently needed. Since the processes leading to clinically symptomatic asthma start early in life, we set out to systematically evaluate a neonatal immunotherapeutic based on Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) for the control of allergic sensitization. We modified Lm to express the model allergen, ovalbumin (OVA), and tested the ability of neonatal immunization with this strain to control allergic sensitization in a mouse model of OVA-induced asthma. Mice were immunized as newborns with live or heat killed LmOVA or live Lm, followed 6 weeks later by allergic sensitization with OVA. In order to determine whether the TH1-polarizing effect of this vaccine vector inadvertently may exacerbate development of certain TH1-driven allergic diseases, mice immunized as newborns were assessed in a model of adult hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Both LmOVA and Lm-control vaccines were highly effective in providing long-lasting protection from airway inflammation after only one immunization given perinatally. Serum antibody levels and lung cytokine production suggest that this prophylactic strategy is associated with an allergen specific TH1-dominated response. Specifically, LmOVA vaccinated mice displayed significantly elevated OVA-specific serum IgG2a, but no difference in anti-OVA IgE antibodies and only slightly decreased anti-OVA IgG1 antibodies. Importantly, Lm-based neonatal vaccination did not exacerbate Th1/Th17 driven HP, arguing against broad spectrum immune skewing.",

The role of mitochondria in degenerative diseases is widely recognized. We undertook this study to evaluate mitochondrial function in normal and OA chondrocytes and to examine age-related changes in mitochondria. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by analyzing respiratory chain enzyme complexes and citrate synthase (CS) activities as well as changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m). The activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (complex I: rotenone-sensitive NADH-coenzyme Q(1) reductase; complex II: succinate dehydrogenase; complex III: antimycin-sensitive ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; and complex IV: cytochrome c oxidase) and CS were measured in human articular chondrocytes isolated from OA and normal cartilage. Delta Psi m was measured by JC-1 using flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t-test as well as several models of multiple linear regression. OA articular chondrocytes had reduced activities of complexes II and III compared with cells from normal cartilage. However, the mitochondrial mass was increased in OA. Cultures of OA chondrocytes contained a higher proportion of cells with de-energized mitochondria. We found no relationship between mitochondrial function and donor age either in normal or in OA chondrocytes.",

We also examined whether administering testosterone can reverse the changes. Male 12 weeks-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into three experimental groups; sham-castration (Control), the castration group (Cast), and the castration plus testosterone propionate group (Cast+TP). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were evoked in the CA1 area of the hippocampus by stimulating the commissural fibers of the contralateral hippocampus. Field EPSPs were evoked in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) by stimulating the ipsilateral perforant path fibers. Laminar analysis of the fEPSPs in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer did not differ significantly between the three experimental groups. However, paired pulse facilitation (PPF) of the fEPSP with short inter-stimulus intervals (30 to 100 msec) was significantly suppressed in Cast group. This suppression was reversed by testosterone injection (Cast+TP). Longterm potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 pyramidal neurons by high frequency stimulation (HFS) did not differ significantly between the three experimental groups, whereas potentiation evoked by primed burst stimulation (PBS) was much weaker in the Cast group compared with the Control group. Testosterone injection restored the PBS-induced potentiation to the control level. Synaptic transmission between perforant pathway and the granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) did not differ significantly among the three experimental groups.",

However, little is known about JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Thus, iDCs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and performed to explore the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in the two signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during EV71 replication. We showed that EV71 infection could activate both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in iDCs and phosphorylate their downstream transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, which further promoted the production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Moreover, EV71 infection also increased the release of IFN-β and IL-12 p40. Pretreatment of iDCs with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 μM) could severely impair viral replication and its induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2,p38 MAPK, c-Fos and c-Jun.

We estimated the risk of AKI among patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy using OSP vs polyethylene glycol (PEG) for bowel cleansing in a large, US-based claims database. We used an insurance database to identify a cohort of patients ages 50 to 75 years who underwent screening colonoscopies as outpatients from January 2000 through November 2008 (before the Food and Drug Administration warning), receiving OSP (n = 121,266) or PEG (n = 429,430) within 30 days beforehand, without prior use of either drug. We collected data from patients for 6 months afterward to identify those who developed AKI or renal failure, or received dialysis. Adjusted and propensity score-matched hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. We investigated the effects in subgroups with higher AKI risk (patients with chronic kidney disease, kidney stones, hypertension, or diabetes, or using antihypertensive or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). AKI occurred in 0.2% of OSP users and in 0.3% of PEG users (adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99). OSP users matched well with PEG users, producing similar estimates (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.01).

In addition, the effect of tenidap on IL-1 stimulated collagenase gene expression was studied. Binding assays were performed using [125I]-IL-1 beta as radioligand. Flow cytometry was done using a specific antibody against type I IL-1R. Protein synthesis was determined by [3H]-leucine incorporation. Levels of expression were determined by Northern Blot for collagenase and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for type I IL-1R. Tenidap produced for both OA and RA synovial fibroblasts a dose dependent decrease in the number of IL-1 binding sites/cell. A reduction of 41% (2.5 micrograms/ml) to 81% (at therapeutic concentration, 20 micrograms/ml) was noted for OA, while 29% (2.5 micrograms/ml) to 89% (20 micrograms/ml) was found for RA cells. Diclofenac produced no effect on OA cells, and minimal inhibition of RA synovial fibroblasts was observed only at pharmacological concentration (12%, 300 mg/ml). Hydroxychloroquine had effects similar to diclofenac. The decreased number of IL-1 binding sites/cell by tenidap was time dependent and reached 93% inhibition after 48 h. The effect of tenidap appears to be posttranscriptional, judged by the marked reduction of the type I IL-1R protein/cell and the absence of effect on its mRNA level. Tenidap also markedly reduced the IL-1 induced collagenase expression in synovial fibroblasts.",

The decrease in fertility is a major cause of cow culling and economic loss in the dairy herd. The conception rate has been declining for the past 30-50 years. Conception rate is the product of fertilization and embryonic survival rates. In a previous study, we have identified associations of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the signal transducer and activator 5A (STAT5A) with fertilization and survival rates in an in vitro experimental system. The objectives of this study are to fine map the STAT5A region in a search for causative mutations and to investigate the parent of origin expression of this gene. We have performed a total of 5,222 fertilizations and produced a total of 3,696 in vitro fertilized embryos using gametes from 440 cows and eight bulls. A total of 37 SNPs were developed in a 63.4-kb region of genomic sequence that includes STAT5A, STAT3, and upstream and downstream sequences of these genes. SNP153137 (G/C) in exon 8 of STAT5A was associated with a significant variability in embryonic survival and fertilization rate compared to all other examined SNPs. Expression analysis revealed that STAT5A is primarily monoallelically expressed in early embryonic stages but biallelically expressed in later fetal stages. Furthermore, the occurrence of monoallelic maternal expression of STAT5A was significantly higher in blastocysts, while paternal expression was more frequent in degenerative embryos.",

The collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) protein expressed by activated stromal cells of diverse origin has previously been implicated in tissue remodeling and carcinogenesis. We recently discovered that the synovial Cthrc1 mRNA directly correlates with arthritis severity in mice. This study characterizes the role of CTHRC1 in arthritic pannus formation. Synovial joints of mice with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) and human RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were immunostained for CTHRC1, FLS and macrophage-specific markers. CTHRC1 levels in plasma from patients with RA were measured using sandwich ELISA. The migratory response of fibroblasts was studied with a transwell migration assay and time-lapse microscopy. Velocity and directness of cell migration was analyzed by recording the trajectories of cells treated with rhCTHRC1. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and inflamed synovium revealed highly inducible expression of CTHRC1 in arthritis (10.9-fold). At the tissue level, CTHRC1-expressing cells occupied the same niche as large fibroblast-like cells positive for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and cadherin 11 (CDH11). CTHRC1 was produced by activated FLS predominantly located at the synovial intimal lining and at the bone-pannus interface. Cultured RA-FLS expressed CDH11, α-SMA, and CTHRC1.

PolyHeme (Northfield Laboratories, Evanston, IL), a hemoglobin-based substitute that is free of priming agents, provides an alternative. We hypothesized that PMN priming would be attenuated in patients resuscitated with PolyHeme in lieu of stored blood. Injured patients requiring urgent transfusion were given either PolyHeme (up to 20 units) or PRBCs. Early postinjury PMN priming was measured via beta-2 integrin expression, superoxide production, and elastase release.

We previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing ascorbic acid, lysine, proline, and green tea extract in vitro: on activity of urokinase plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs in various human glioblastoma (LN-18, T-98G and A-172) cell lines and on glioblastoma A-172 cell proliferation and Matrigel invasion. Our main objective in this study was to investigate the effect of the NM in vivo on human glioblastoma U-87 MG cell line. Athymic male nude mice inoculated with 3·10(6) U-87 MG cells subcutaneously and were fed a regular diet or a regular diet supplemented with 0.5% NM. Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed, the tumors were weighed and measured. The samples were studied histologically. NM inhibited tumor weight and tumor burden by 53% (p = 0.015) and 48% (p = 0.010), respectively.",
    "response": "These results suggest the therapeutic potential of NM as an adjuvant in the treatment of glioblastoma.",
