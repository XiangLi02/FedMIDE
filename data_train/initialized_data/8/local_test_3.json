    "response": "Hi, Thanks for the query. It is normal to have some discomfort during intrauterine insemination. But to be sure of the situation, a proper physical evaluation would be required. If the pain and discomfort persist, you may have to undergo an ultrasonography of the abdomen to rule out any other abnormalities. So it is better to be examined by your doctor if the problem persists. Hope I have been of some help to you. If any further queries, please feel free to ask. Thank you. Regards",

    "response": "Welcome to Chat Doctor! I have gone through your question, and it says that your father is on next forte and risperidone. You have not mentioned the dosage of any of them. Next forte is safe in this age, except when thee is severe liver dysfunction, it has the least interaction with other medicines, but, may cause reduction in sodium levels, especially in old age. This happens more when there is already existing liver or kidney problems. One needs to get sodium and other electrolytes checked to see if that is causing disorientation/ other deteriorating symptoms. You should have mentioned the deteriorating symptoms, this would rally have helped in telling the possible cause... Risperidone is also usually safe in low dose, and actually an effective medicine. In some patients it may cause disorientation, delirium, and rigidity (tightening of limbs), increase in salivation and slurring of speech... So, whatever it is, please talk to his doctor, after evaluation and looking at the patient one can tell what is happening. I know it is troublesome, but sometimes even the right medicine may cause distress in few patients.  These Chat Doctor.  His doctor may go for some other safe and low potency medicine or education the dosage of these only. I hope your father gets well sooner free to ask more questions",

    "response": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A A breast cancer which has to be treated with chemotherapy is a malignant for sure. However, a malignant tumor is not treated by lumpectomy. Mastectomy is the treatment for a malignant breast tumor. Chemotherapy is added in the treatment protocol if lymph nodes are involved by tumor metastasis. A breast which is not responsive to hormonal therapy is likely to be triple negative tumor or basal like tumor. Invasive lobular carcinoma tends to affect bilateral breasts thus in your case bilateral mastectomy was done. In your sisters case a minimum of unilateral mastectomy has to be done. Kindly, consult your doctor again for confirmation of the lesion-benign or malignant. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. ",

    "response": "Hello, Due to your job profile, there will be an additional weakness of the muscles of the spinal column leading to compression over the disc which is in between the two vertebral bodies.  To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis. At most times the disc which is situated in between the vertebral bodies loses the water content in that leading to reduced intervertebral disc place. I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined, and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended.  Also, physical therapy will be helpful to correct functional scoliosis and also improving muscle strength with some exercise of correcting the spinal column. Hope I have answered your query.

    "instruction": "Hi, I m a 17 year old girl from New Zealand. Since a few years ago, I have been quite aware of the fact that I have a high probability of being a high-functioning autistic. I did some research at my local autism centre and everything seems clear, but my parents - especially my mother - continue to deny the allegations, saying that I m just making excuses and that you re not autistic or whatever, you re just stupid . Here are the things I have discovered. - I stayed in kindergarten 6 months longer than I should have been due to my development delay problems (late speaking, wearing diapers until I was 4, etc). Even before then, I apparently had a special needs carer/tutor lady come into my house. - I am socially anxious, and have trouble socializing or interacting with other people unless it is completely necessary. Up until I entered high school (13 years old), I was not very social and only talked to a select group of people. - I did not speak until I was 5, and according to my mother, when I did speak it was just simple phrases like Yes or No , and even then it was only to certain people such as member of my family (Mother, father, older brother by 2 years). - Every school I have been in has placed me in their GATE society (the Gifted and Talented programme), and they have placed me in nearly every annual Creative Writing programme held at school, and after reading all the Gifted information that the school provided there s a fine line between Gifted and Autistic. - I don t know if you ve already observed it from here, but I have this extended vocabulary which I sometimes wish I didn t have. Sometimes I think I speak like I have Asperger s Syndrome. - There s this online autism test created by Simon Baron Cohen that was featured in (I think) Embarrassing Bodies. I took it and got a score of 35. I d really like to get a diagnosis so at least I m aware of whether I m autistic or not. I know this isn t enough information but it s the most I can do via the Internet. Thank you.",

    "response": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you are wondering whether you may be having a diagnosis of Autism / Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, a detailed history (including a childhood history from your parents) and a detailed psychological assessment is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Usually, Autistic Spectrum Disorders get diagnosed early in childhood itself, with one criteria being that the onset of symptoms should have been before the age of 3 years. If you would like to clarify your doubt, I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation. Online tests, especially the self-rated ones are usually unreliable.

    "response": "Hi there,Both Phaeton and Cyclones are same hormone progesterone, but the method of intake is different. They are given to support pregnancy, but exactly how useful they are in preventing miscarriage is yet to be proven. The fact that the ultrasound is normal and fetal heart rate is good implies that things are ok. Once the fetal heart beat appears there is very little chance of you having a miscarriage. I understand with your previous history of miscarriage you must be very anxious but the stress and anxiety can make matters worse for you. The bleeding should subside by around 12 weeks. The oral form Phaeton is easier to take and less cumbersome. Threatened miscarriage is common in early pregnancy and only supportive care with rest is advised. You could continue either of the progesterones, whichever you are more comfortable with. Get a repeat scan after 10 days to check for fetal well-being. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.",

I understand that she has decompensated cryogenic cirrhosis.

TIPS is a good and acceptable procedure for intractable ascites and gives good comfort to the patient. This procedure should ideally be done in a center experienced in TIPS.

    "response": "Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps.",

So whenever neuroma occurs, it means some nerve damage. It can cause severe burning pain due to abnormal nerve regeneration. Weakness of muscle and sensory loss occurs due to nerve damage. The management of neuroma is either conservative or surgical excision and repair of nerve. Conservative management is indicated: If there is no or mild symptoms: Symptom of burning pain only which is responsive to painkillers like Pregabalin/Gabapentin/Amitriptyline : Old neuroma of more than 2 years old witChatDoctorplete functional loss. Surgery at this stage usually does not cause any functional recovery. Surgery is indicated if: Intractable pain not responding to painkillers: Neuroma of less than 2 years with functional loss - Excising neuroma and joining nerve ends may lead to some functional recovery. But before deciding for surgery, nerve studies are done to find out the degree of damage, site of neuroma, affected muscle.

For headache and fullness in ear, it could be due to ear infection/upper respiratory tract infection, you should consult ENT specialist.

Healing is progressive and this is why you had to go on an anti-reflux/anti-secretory for some weeks again after your antibiotherapy. If I were your treating Doctor, I will, would have treated as follows:-Antibiotherapy for 14 days-Anti-secretory like omeprazole for 21 to 28 days-Antacid like maalox-Counseling on home measure to prevent gastritis/Verdi symptoms do not improve, I send you to a Astrologist for examination and a microscopy or endoscopy. If you are still struggling with your symptoms, I will advise you see a Astrologist for evaluation and better management. Hope this will help Best regards",

Normally when I take laxatives they take 6hrs to take effect and then my bowels release heavily about three times. It s uncomfortable only right before I, er, poo and then it goes away.

Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course.

The history which you have provided regarding your pregnancy and associated complications during childbirth are also suggestive of the same. Your baby will require evaluation for seizures in the form of EEG, and she might also require neuroimaging like ultrasound cranium or an MRI brain.

There are tiny bumps in a patch where it is itching and it kind of flares up when im scratching it. When im not messing with it I dont feel any bumps. I hate to have to go to the doctor. Oh there is no burning when i urinate or redness or itchiness in my vagina just on the crease of my inner thighs. And the itchiness comes and goes only when I scratch. I often wear spanx and have picked up some weight. And I ve had a weak bladder recently making it difficult to get to the bathroom fast enough. I find that this region has been moist recently due to sweat.",

I am now pregnant. I am 15 weeks. Since Ive been pregnant, I notice it has been happening more. I always have to take a deep breath to catch my breath. Is something wrong?",
    "context": "",
    "response": "Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  In pregnancy there is rise in blood volume (for fetal circulation). This is by dilution of blood, so the hemoglobin percentage (the oxygen carrying substance) gets reduced. Also, respiration become difficult due to decreased due to pregnancy hormones, while oxygen demand is increased by 20% in pregnancy.  All these factors together cause compensatory rise in respiratory rate & heart rate. In an attempt to provide necessary oxygen to growing fetus.  The thing can be managed by- - Rise in HBO (treatment/ consumption of healthy diet with proteins, iron, vitamins) - Learning to increase respiratory capacity by using thoracic breathing (pregnancy special Panama) thanks.",
