RCAS is an R/Bioconductor package but there are also graphical user interfaces including a Galaxy wrapper and a stand-alone web service. The application of RCAS on published datasets shows that RCAS is not only able to reproduce published findings but also helps generate novel knowledge and hypotheses. The meta-gene profiles, gene-centric annotation, motif analysis and gene-set analysis provided by RCAS provide contextual knowledge which is necessary for understanding the functional aspects of different biological events that involve RNAs. In addition, the array of different interfaces and deployment options adds the convenience of use for different levels of users.

    "context": "",
    "response": "Fetal hemoglobin, or foetal haemoglobin,  is the main oxygen transport protein in the human fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.\nUnusually high levels of fetal haemoglobin production can ameliorate sickle cell disease and β thalassaemia. Although efforts directed at the pharmacological stimulation of fetal haemoglobin as an approach to managing these conditions have met with limited success, there is wide variation in individual responses. \nBased on results, adults humans could be induced to produce fetal hemoglobin.",

Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation.",

Gemcitabine and prolonged oral etoposide have shown reproducible single-agent activity in patients with platinum/paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. The combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine resulted in significantly higher response rates and improved progression-free survival when compared with carboplatin alone.

The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.  T3 induces mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, T3 treatment for 72h  increases activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha).  Furthermore, L-T3 increases  the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone.\nThe activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis by T3. Truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TRα1, with molecular weights of 43 kDa (p43) and 28 Kda have been previously identified in mitochondria. P43 is a mitochondrial T3 receptor which stimulates mitochondrial transcription and protein synthesis in the presence of T3. p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity.",

This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma.

Prolamellar bodies have been discovered in etioplasts with the use of thin section electron microscopy. Etioplasts develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark. During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms the photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes. Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) efficiently capture the light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. Upon illumination, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts.

The b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs.  Elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.  When compared, the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters were found to have several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. This suggests that the regulation of Hox genes is highly conserved across chordates, consistent with the similar Hox expression patterns in vertebrates and amphioxus.",

    "context": "",
    "response": "Yes. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to simply as autophagy) is a catabolic process conserved throughout the eukaryotes, and is distinct from other forms of autophagy by the formation of the autophagosome: this is a vesicle-like formation surrounded by a double membrane that sequesters the cytoplasmic material to be degraded. It was initially considered that macroautophagy was a bulk process; however, recent findings illustrate that specific cargos (ranging from misfolded or excess proteins, to organelles or even bacterial cells) can be selectively targeted to the pre-autophagosome membrane (i.e. the phagophore) and finally to the vacuoles/lysosomes for their degradation.",

Such heterogeneity can arise due to technical or biological factors, making decomposing sources of variation difficult. F-scLVM (factorial single-cell latent variable model) is a method based on factor analysis that uses pathway annotations to guide the inference of interpretable factors underpinning the heterogeneity. The model jointly estimates the relevance of individual factors, refines gene set annotations, and infers factors without annotation. F-scLVM robustly decomposes scRNA-seq datasets into interpretable components, thereby facilitating the identification of novel subpopulations.",
