He elaborates on how the five internal organs, also known as the five elements or five phases (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), are associated with different flavors. Consuming an excess of a particular flavor can harm the corresponding organ, leading to illness. For instance, consuming too much sour food can damage the liver, while too much salt can harm the kidneys. The document advises people to protect themselves during certain seasons to avoid illness and maintain good health and longevity. For example, during the winter months, one should avoid overexertion and conserve energy to prevent illness in the spring. Similarly, protecting the neck during the spring can prevent illness in the summer, and avoiding excessive sweating during the summer can prevent illness in the fall.
