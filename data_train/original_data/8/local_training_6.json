    "instruction": "Do activation of Erk and JNK MAPK pathways by acute swim stress in rat brain regions?",
    "context": "The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to participate in a wide array of cellular functions. A role for some MAPKs (e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Erk1/2) has been documented in response to certain physiological stimuli, such as ischemia, visceral pain and electroconvulsive shock. We recently demonstrated that restraint stress activates the Erk MAPK pathway, but not c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) or p38MAPK, in several rat brain regions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a different stressor, acute forced swim stress, on the phosphorylation (P) state of these MAPKs in the hippocampus, neocortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum. In addition, effects on the phosphorylation state of the upstream activators of the MAPKs, their respective MAPK kinases (MAPKKs; P-MEK1/2, P-MKK4 and P-MKK3/6), were determined. Finally, because the Erk pathway can activate c-AMP response element (CRE) binding (CREB) protein, and swim stress has recently been reported to enhance CREB phosphorylation, changes in P-CREB were also examined. A single 15 min session of forced swimming increased P-Erk2 levels 2-3-fold in the neocortex, prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in the hippocampus or amygdala. P-JNK levels (P-JNK1 and/or P-JNK2/3) were increased in all brain regions about 2-5-fold, whereas P-p38MAPK levels remained essentially unchanged. Surprisingly, levels of the phosphorylated MAPKKs, P-MEK1/2 and P-MKK4 (activators of the Erk and JNK pathways, respectively) were increased in all five brain regions, and much more dramatically (P-MEK1/2, 4.5 to > 100-fold; P-MKK4, 12 to approximately 300-fold). Consistent with the lack of forced swim on phosphorylation of p38MAPK, there appeared to be no change in levels of its activator, P-MKK3/6. P-CREB was increased in all but cortical (prefrontal, neocortex) areas.",
    "response": "Swim stress specifically and markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of the MAPKKs P-MEK1/2 and P-MKK4 in all brain regions tested without apparent alteration in the phosphorylation of P-MKK3/6. Curiously, phosphorylation of their cognate substrates (Erk and JNK) was increased to a much more modest extent, and in some brain regions was not altered. Similarly, there was a region-specific discrepancy between Erk and CREB phosphorylation. Possible explanations for these findings and comparison with the effects of restraint stress will be discussed.",

    "context": "There is a claim in folklore medicine in Nigeria that trona (a sesquicarbonate or hydrated carbonate of sodium) causes fetal loss. However, this has not been substantiated or refuted by any scientific evidence. This study evaluates whether or not trona causes fetal loss in pregnant female Wistar rats. Pregnant Wistar rats of comparable weights were randomized into three groups. Group A (control) was given a single dose of 1.25 mL/kg body weight of lime while group B and C were given 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg body weight of trona, respectively. There was no significant difference in the body weight gained across all the groups. 250 mg/kg body weight of trona decreased the number of live fetus, while 500 mg/kg body weight produced no live fetus; 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg body weight of trona led to fetal loss rate of 83.33% and 100%, respectively. Trona also reduced the concentrations of serum progesterone and cholesterol, and increased serum oestradiol.",

    "context": "Blood pressure (BP) homeostasis involves complex interactions among genetic and nongenetic factors, providing major challenges to dissection of the genetic components that influence BP and hypertension. In this study, we examine the effects of interaction of genetic variants with physical activity on BP in a relatively genetically homogenous cohort of rural Chinese villagers. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to test for associations of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with variants in 24 genes in BP pathways (196 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) among 3,142 Chinese participants divided according to physical activity (active vs. inactive groups). In the physically active group, two SNPs in NR3C2 were significantly associated with lower SBP, and a SNP in SCNN1B was significantly associated with lower SBP and DBP. In the physically inactive group, a SNP in APLNR was associated with lower SBP, a SNP in GNB3 (guanine nucleotide binding protein, β polypeptide 3) was associated with higher SBP and DBP, and a SNP in BDKRB2 (bradykinin receptor B2) was associated with lower DBP. Cumulative effects in carriers of minor alleles of these SNPs showed reductions of SBP and DBP as large as 8 and 5 mm Hg, respectively, in the active individuals compared to inactive individuals carrying the same number of minor alleles.",
    "response": "We found that physical activity modifies the effects of genetic variants on BP.

Seventy-four patients with gastric outlet obstruction underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained from any suspicious looking lesions or from the most distal point at which the endoscope could be positioned. In 56 patients (76%) the cause of the gastric outlet obstruction was malignant. On clinical and endoscopic appearance three patients were wrongly diagnosed as having malignancy when the cause, on endoscopic biopsy, was benign (tuberculosis n = 2, and immunoproliferative small intestinal disease n = 1). Twelve of the 18 patients with benign gastric outlet obstruction were managed conservatively with drugs and endoscopic balloon dilatation.",

    "context": "To investigate the potential tumour suppressor functions of glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7) and examine the interplay between epigenetic and genetic events in regulating its expression in oesophageal adenocarcinomas (OAC). In vitro and in vivo cell models were developed to investigate the biological and molecular functions of GPX7 in OAC. Reconstitution of GPX7 in OAC cell lines, OE33 and FLO-1, significantly suppressed growth as shown by the growth curve, colony formation and EdU proliferation assays. Meanwhile, GPX7-expressing cells displayed significant impairment in G1/S progression and an increase in cell senescence. Concordant with the above functions, Western blot analysis displayed higher levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 with a decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (RB), indicating its increased tumour suppressor activities. On the contrary, knockdown of GPX7 in HET1A cells (an immortalised normal oesophageal cell line) rendered the cells growth advantage as indicated with a higher EdU rate, lower levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 and an increase in phosphorylated RB. We confirmed the tumour suppressor function in vivo using GPX7-expressing OE33 cells in a mouse xenograft model. Pyrosequencing of the GPX7 promoter region (-162 to +138) demonstrated location-specific hypermethylation between +13 and +64 in OAC (69%, 54/78). This was significantly associated with the downregulation of GPX7 (p<0.01). Neither mutations in the coding exons of GPX7 nor DNA copy number losses were frequently present in the OAC examined (<5%).",

    "context": "Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) via subcutaneous osmotic pumps into mice promotes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). These AngII-induced AAAs develop via a complex process in which there is a transmedial break, lumen dilation, thrombus formation, inflammation involving cells of both the innate and acquired immune systems, and remodeling. The recent development of a high-frequency ultrasound machine has permitted the noninvasive detection of murine abdominal aortas. We assessed the ability of a Visualsonics Vevo 660 high-resolution imaging system to detect AAAs and sequentially quantify the aortic luminal diameter. This system had 100% accuracy in detecting AngII-induced AAAs in vivo, with intrauser and interuser variation coefficients of less than 10% for quantification of the aortic lumen diameter. Male apolipoprotein E (apoE)(-/-) mice were infused subcutaneously with either saline or AngII and were monitored with this ultrasonic system to define the temporal changes in aortic lumen diameter. Aortic luminal diameters were measured in the aneurysm-susceptible region of the suprarenal aorta. For internal controls, abdominal aortic diameters were measured at the level of the left renal branch, because this landmark region did not dilate during AngII infusion. Luminal diameters of the suprarenal aorta did not change significantly in saline-infused mice over 28 days of measurement (P = .71). In contrast, AngII infusion led to rapid dilation of suprarenal aortas during the initial 7 days of infusion (0.071 mm/d; P = .0037 for the change in the initial expansion rate). Further luminal diameter expansions occurred for the remaining 21 days of observation at a more modest rate (0.023 mm/d; P = .0001 for continued expansion after day 7). Within the initial 14 days of AngII infusion, some apoE(-/-) mice died as a result of rupture of the aorta in the suprarenal region. We had previously assumed that aortic dilation and rupture occurred simultaneously. However, in the AngII-infused mice that succumbed to aortic rupture, luminal diameters increased several days before death.",

A better understanding of the type of immune response causing graft-versus-host disease in defined clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplant settings is required to inform development of methods for monitoring patients and providing them tailored care. Twenty-five patients were recruited presenting with myeloid malignancies and treated with a reduced intensity conditioning transplant regimen with graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprising in vivo lymphocyte depletion with alemtuzumab and cyclosporin. A prospective study was performed of lymphocyte subset reconstitution in peripheral blood in relation to the incidence of graft-versus-host disease. Acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with significantly higher numbers of natural killer cells and donor-derived effector CD4 T cells (CD45RO(+) CD27(-)) early (day 30) after transplantation (p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively). This association was evident before the emergence of clinical pathology in six out of seven patients.

    "context": "The Liu Comorbidity Index uses the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) to quantify comorbidity in chronic dialysis patients, capturing baseline comorbidities from days 91 through 270 after dialysis initiation. The 270 day survival requirement results in sample size reductions and potential survivor bias. An earlier and shorter time-frame for data capture could be beneficial, if sufficiently similar comorbidity information could be ascertained. USRDS data were used in a retrospective observational study of 70,114 Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible persons who initiated chronic dialysis during the years 2000-2005. The Liu index was modified by changing the baseline comorbidity capture period to days 1-90 after dialysis initiation for persons continuously enrolled in Medicare. The scores resulting from the original and the modified comorbidity indices were compared, and the impact on sample size was calculated. The original Liu comorbidity index could be calculated for 75% of the sample, but the remaining 25% did not survive to 270 days. Among 52,937 individuals for whom both scores could be calculated, the mean scores for the original and the modified index were 7.4 ± 4.0 and 6.4 ± 3.6 points, respectively, on a 24-point scale. The most commonly calculated difference between scores was zero, occurring in 44% of patients. Greater comorbidity was found in those who died before 270 days.",

Initial body weight (BW) and kidney weight (KW) were significantly reduced in ID vs. N mice, while KW/BW ratios were similar. KW increased post-UNx to a comparable extent in ID and N mice (125±4 and 118±6% of pre-UNx KW, p<0.05 vs. C). Kidney IGF-I mRNA levels were similar in the ID and N mice and did not change post-UNx. Kidney IGF-I peptide levels pre-UNx were significantly lower in ID vs. N mice (25±5 vs. 305±39ng/g) and increased in both groups after UNx, remaining low in ID mice (45±4 in ID vs 561±64ng/g in N).

    "context": "Cross-face nerve grafting combined with functional muscle transplantation has become the standard in reconstructing an emotionally controlled smile in complete irreversible facial palsy. However, the efficacy of this procedure depends on the ability of regenerating axons to breach two nerve coaptations and reinnervate endplates in denervated muscle. The current study tested the hypothesis that adipose-derived stem cells would enhance axonal regeneration through a cross-facial nerve graft and thereby enhance recovery of the facial nerve function. Twelve rats underwent transection of the right facial nerve, and cross-facial nerve grafting using the sciatic nerve as an interpositional graft, with coaptations to the ipsilateral and contralateral buccal branches, was carried out. Rats were divided equally into two groups: a grafted but nontreated control group and a grafted and adipose-derived stem cell-treated group. Three months after surgery, biometric and electrophysiologic assessments of vibrissae movements were performed. Histologically, the spectra of fiber density, myelin sheath thickness, fiber diameter, and g ratio of the nerve were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for the evaluation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junctions. The data from the biometric and electrophysiologic analysis of vibrissae movements, immunohistochemical analysis, and histologic assessment of the nerve showed that adipose-derived stem cells significantly enhanced axonal regeneration through the graft.",

The predictive value of NLR in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has not been well studied. We aimed to evaluate whether NLR predicted disease recurrence and progression in NMIBC. The medical records of 122 consecutive, newly diagnosed, patients with NMIBC treated with transurethral tumor resection, between the years 2003 and 2010, were reviewed. Patients with hematological malignancies (n = 4) and without preoperative NLR (n = 11) were excluded. Cutoff points for NLR were tested separately for recurrence and progression using the standardized cutoff-finder algorithm. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between NLR and disease recurrence and progression. The study cohort comprised 91 men and 16 women at a median age of 68 years. The median NLR was 2.85 (interquartile range: 2-3.9). In total, 68 patients (64%) had an NLR>2.41. Patients with NLR>2.41 were more often men (P = 0.02) and had T1 category tumors (P = 0.034). Analyzed as a continuous variable, higher NLR showed a weak positive association with high tumor grade (R = 0.21, P = 0.028). The median follow-up for patients without disease recurrence was 40 months (interquartile range: 23-51).

We developed a recombinant minicircle vector carrying the human IFNgamma gene and evaluated the effects of minicircle-mediated IFNgamma gene transfer on NPC cell lines in vitro and on xenografts in vivo. Relative to p2PhiC31-IFNgamma, minicircle-mediated IFNgamma gene transfer in vitro resulted in 19- to 102-fold greater IFNgamma expression levels in transfected cells (293, NIH 3T3, CNE-1, CNE-2, and C666-1) and inhibited the growth of CNE-1, CNE-2, and C666-1 cells more efficiently, reducing relative growth rates to 7.1 +/- 1.6%, 2.7 +/- 1.0%, and 6.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively. Flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assays suggested that the antiproliferative effects of IFNgamma gene transfer on NPC cell lines could be attributed to G(0)-G(1) arrest and apoptosis. Minicircle-mediated intratumoral IFNgamma expression in vivo was 11 to 14 times higher than p2PhiC31-IFNgamma in CNE-2- and C666-1-xenografted mice and lasted for 21 days. Compared with p2PhiC31-IFNgamma treatment, minicircle-IFNgamma treatment significantly increased survival and achieved inhibition rates of 77.5% and 83%, respectively.",
    "response": "Our data indicate that IFNgamma gene transfer exerts antiproliferative effects on NPC cells in vitro and leads to a profound antitumor effect in vivo.

    "instruction": "Is amino-terminal extension present in the methionine aminopeptidase type 1c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis indispensible for its activity?",
    "context": "Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) is a ubiquitous enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which catalyzes co-translational removal of N-terminal methionine from elongating polypeptide chains during protein synthesis. It specifically removes the terminal methionine in all organisms, if the penultimate residue is non-bulky and uncharged. The MetAP action for exclusion of N-terminal methionine is mandatory in 50-70% of nascent proteins. Such an activity is required for proper sub cellular localization, additional processing and eventually for the degradation of proteins. We cloned genes encoding two such metalloproteases (MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and expressed them as histidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Although they have different substrate preferences, for Met-Ala-Ser, we found, MtMetAP1c had significantly high enzyme turnover rate as opposed to MtMetAP1a. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies as well as monitoring of enzyme activity indicated high temperature stability (up to 50 °C) of MtMetAP1a compared to that of the MtMetAP1c. Modelling of MtMetAP1a based on MtMetAP1c crystal structure revealed the distinct spatial arrangements of identical active site amino acid residues and their mutations affected the enzymatic activities of both the proteins. Strikingly, we observed that 40 amino acid long N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c, compared to its other family members, contributes towards the activity and stability of this enzyme, which has never been reported for any methionine aminopeptidase. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that Val-18 and Pro-19 of MtMetAP1c are crucial for its enzymatic activity. Consistent with this observation, molecular dynamic simulation studies of wild-type and these variants strongly suggest their involvement in maintaining active site conformation of MtMetAP1c.",

In the early stage of glomerulosclerosis occur renal mesangial expansion and renal filtration dysfunction. Purple corn has been classified as a functional food and is rich in anthocyanins exerting potential disease-preventive activities. The in vitro study using human renal mesangial cells examined that anthocyanin-rich purple corn butanol fraction (PCB) can attenuate high glucose (HG)-promoted mesangial cell proliferation and matrix accumulation. Cells were cultured for 3 days in media containing 33 mM glucose in the presence of 1-20 μg/mL PCB. In the in vivo animal study, db/db mice were treated with 10 mg/kg anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic extracts of purple corn (PCE) for 8 weeks. HG enhanced mesangial production of the fibrosis biomarkers of collagen IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was markedly attenuated by adding PCB. Such mesangial fibrosis entailed interleukin-8 activation via eliciting Tyk2-STAT signaling pathway. PCB dampened HG-promoted mesangial hyperplasia that appeared to be attributed to increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor. The 8-week administration of PCE lowered plasma glucose level of db/db mice and ameliorated severe albuminuria. Moreover, PCE lessened collagen fiber accumulation in kidney glomeruli and CTGF expression via retarding TGF-β signaling. Protein expressions of nephrin and podocin, key proteins for filtration barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall, were repressed by treating mice with PCE.",

Chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis induces cardiac hypertrophy independent of blood pressure by increasing protein synthesis in vivo. KCOs attenuate calcium overload and confer cardioprotection against ischemic stress, and thereby prevent myocardial remodeling. Twelve Wistar-Kyoto rat groups underwent 8 weeks of the drug treatment in combination with NO synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inactive isomer D omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(D-NAME), KCOs(nicorandil; 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, or JTV-506; 0.3 mg/kg/day), or a KATP channel blocker glibenclamide. L-NAME was also treated with hydralazine, p70S6K inhibitor (rapamycin) or MAP kinase kinase inhibitor(PD98059).

Some of the functions of Id4 appear to be unique as compared to its other family members Id1, Id2 and Id3. Loss of Id4 gene expression in many cancers in association with promoter hypermethylation has led to the proposal that Id4 may act as a tumor suppressor. In this study we provide functional evidence that Id4 indeed acts as a tumor suppressor and is part of a cancer associated epigenetic re-programming. Data mining was used to demonstrate Id4 expression in prostate cancer. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis was performed to understand molecular mechanisms associated with Id4 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 cells was determined by cell cycle analysis (3H thymidine incorporation and FACS), expression of androgen receptor, p53 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 by a combination of RT-PCR, real time-PCR, western blot and immuno-cytochemical analysis. Id4 expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer. Id4 expression was also down-regulated in prostate cancer line DU145 due to promoter hyper-methylation. Ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 prostate cancer cell line led to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation due in part by an S-phase arrest. In addition to S-phase arrest, ectopic Id4 expression in PC3 cells also resulted in prolonged G2/M phase. At the molecular level these changes were associated with increased androgen receptor (AR), p21, p27 and p53 expression in DU145 cells.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visits to private gynaecologists correlate with better health outcomes and worse participation in organised screening for cancer programs. This is an ecological analysis using municipalities and groups of women at 5-year age intervals within municipalities as study units. First, the Finnish municipalities (n = 452) were classified into three groups by the age-adjusted level of use of private gynaecologists. Secondly, each age group within municipalities was classified into tertiles by the level of private gynaecologist use. The outcomes were participation in cervical and organised breast cancer screening for cancer programmes, stage of gynaecological and breast cancers at diagnosis, and abortion rates and ratios. All data were obtained from national registers by groups at 5-year age intervals and by municipality. Raw and adjusted (age groups, and in some analyses, municipality social class index) odds ratios, total and by urbanity, were calculated. The proportions of women participating in cervical cancer and organised breast cancer screening for cancer were somewhat higher in the groups having a low use of private gynaecologists. The proportions of local cancers of all cervical, uterine, ovarian and breast cancers were similar in the three groups, even though the first analysis method suggested somewhat better results for the low-use group in case of cervical cancer and for the high-use group in case of uterine and breast cancer.

    "context": "Characterizing young women's willingness to enter motherhood is critical to understanding the high rates of unintended pregnancy among women under 20 years. Our objectives were to discuss a measure called Positive Orientation towards Early Motherhood (POEM), and investigate its association with self-reported unintended pregnancy experience. We used data from 332 African-American women 13-19 years old recruited at public family planning and prenatal clinics in New Orleans. Using a series of ANOVAs and multinomial logistic regression, we assessed differences in POEM between four different outcome groups: women who were never pregnant and those who had only intended pregnancies, only unintended pregnancies and both unintended and intended pregnancies. The data suggested that young women perceive pregnancy as an opportunity to assert responsibility, become closer with their families and achieve greater intimacy with their boyfriends. Multiple regression analysis indicated that this positive orientation toward early motherhood independently raised the likelihood that young women experienced unintended pregnancies. In particular, the perception that a pregnancy makes a young woman feel more responsible was associated with an increased likelihood that a young woman had only unintended pregnancies compared to no pregnancies at all. Interestingly, this perception did not differentiate young women who had only intended pregnancies from those who were never pregnant.",
    "response": "When interpreting reports of unintended pregnancy, more attention should be given to young women's orientation toward early motherhood. Doing so will inform policies that address both personal and structural factors that contribute to persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy among adolescents.",

    "context": "The favorable clinical activity of paclitaxel has prompted considerable interest in combining this agent with other clinically effective antineoplastic agents including the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Our previous studies indicated that simultaneous exposure or pretreatment with 5-FU could significantly interfere with the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Biochemical examination also revealed that 5-FU inhibited expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 that may contribute to paclitaxel cytotoxicity. In this study, human breast cancer BCap37 cells were transfected with either sense or antisense p53 or p21WAF1/CIP1. The established stable transfectants were then analyzed for an altered sensitivity to paclitaxel, 5-FU or the combinations of these drugs using a series of cytotoxic and apoptosis assays. Tumor cells transfected with antisense p53 or p21WAF1/CIP1 exhibited a significant increase in their sensitivity to paclitaxel. The reduced protein levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were also found to abrogate the inhibitory effects of 5-FU on paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis.",

    "instruction": "Do genetically separable functions of the MEC-17 tubulin acetyltransferase affect microtubule organization?",
    "context": "Microtubules (MTs) are formed from the lateral association of 11-16 protofilament chains of tubulin dimers, with most cells containing 13-protofilament (13-p) MTs. How these different MTs are formed is unknown, although the number of protofilaments may depend on the nature of the α- and β-tubulins. Here we show that the enzymatic activity of the Caenorhabiditis elegans α-tubulin acetyltransferase (α-TAT) MEC-17 allows the production of 15-p MTs in the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) MTs. Without MEC-17, MTs with between 11 and 15 protofilaments are seen. Loss of this enzymatic activity also changes the number and organization of the TRN MTs and affects TRN axonal morphology. In contrast, enzymatically inactive MEC-17 is sufficient for touch sensitivity and proper process outgrowth without correcting the MT defects. Thus, in addition to demonstrating that MEC-17 is required for MT structure and organization, our results suggest that the large number of 15-p MTs, normally found in the TRNs, is not essential for mechanosensation.",
    "response": "These experiments reveal a specific role for α-TAT in the formation of MTs and in the production of higher order MTs arrays.

There is evidence that the rs9267551 variant in the DDAH2 gene has a functional impact with the C allele having a higher transcriptional activity resulting in increased expression of DDAH2 in endothelial cells and lower plasma ADMA levels in C allele carriers. To address whether this variant is associated with chronic kidney disease (CDK), 2852 White European were studied. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The proportion of subjects with CKD was significantly lower in C allele carriers than in GG genotype carriers (OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.25-0.97; P = 0.03). In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose, C allele carriers have a lower risk of CKD compared with GG genotype carriers (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18-0.78; P = 0.008). This association was maintained after addition to the logistic regression model of other confounders including glucose tolerance status, presence of dyslipidemia, anti-hypertensive and antidiabetic drugs (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.15-0.80; P = 0.01).",

In the present study, we have investigated whether CB(1) receptor immunoreactive intensity (CB(1)IR intensity) is associated with disease severity and outcome. CB(1)IR was assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens collected with a consecutive intent during primary tumour surgical resection from a series of cases diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Tumour centre (n = 483) and invasive front (n = 486) CB(1)IR was scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (intense staining) and the data was analysed as a median split i.e. CB(1)IR <2 and ≥2. In microsatellite stable, but not microsatellite instable tumours (as adjudged on the basis of immunohistochemical determination of four mismatch repair proteins), there was a significant positive association of the tumour grade with the CB(1)IR intensity. The difference between the microsatellite stable and instable tumours for this association of CB(1)IR was related to the CpG island methylation status of the cases. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses indicated a significant contribution of CB(1)IR to disease-specific survival in the microsatellite stable tumours when adjusting for tumour stage. For the cases with stage II microsatellite stable tumours, there was a significant effect of both tumour centre and front CB(1)IR upon disease specific survival.

The intracellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins has been shown to inhibit activated caspase-3. We investigated the turnover dynamics of cIAP-2 mRNA and caspase-3 protein in a neutrophil ex vivo model of sepsis. PMN (1 x 10(6)/mL) from 7 healthy volunteers were preincubated with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 1 microg/mL) for 5 hours, followed by an additional hour with or without the proteasome inhibitor (30 microM), before incubation with or without agonistic CD95 antibody (100 ng/mL) for another 16 hours. Apoptosis was quantified by Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry (using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter). Caspase-3 activity was determined by DEVD-afc-cleavage assay. Expression of ubiquitinated caspase-3 and cIAP-2 protein was detected by Western blot analysis and cIAP-2 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were subjected to either partial hepatectomy or laparotomy and the levels and subcellular distribution of p53 were studied, following the approach used earlier for CK2. The levels of both proteins were also studied in the human cell lines HL-60 (devoid of p53) and HepG2 (with normal p53 levels) and in fibroblasts from transgenic p53-deficient mice (p53-/-) or homozygous for wild-type p53 (p53+/+). Computer-assisted search was used to detect p53 consensus sequences in genes for CK2 subunits Binding of p53 protein to some of these sequences was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Rat liver p53 protein was present mainly in the fraction extracted from intact nuclei by nucleases (S1) and showed a transient increase at 6 h post partial hepatectomy, as observed previously with nuclear CK2. The human CK2a gene presents the consensus sequence for trans-activation by p53 and specific binding of p53 protein to some of these sequences was detected in vitro.

    "instruction": "Do gene duplications contribute to the overrepresentation of interactions between proteins of a similar age?",
    "context": "The study of biological networks and how they have evolved is fundamental to our understanding of the cell. By investigating how proteins of different ages are connected in the protein interaction network, one can infer how that network has expanded in evolution, without the need for explicit reconstruction of ancestral networks. Studies that implement this approach show that proteins are often connected to proteins of a similar age, suggesting a simultaneous emergence of interacting proteins. There are several theories explaining this phenomenon, but despite the importance of gene duplication in genome evolution, none consider protein family dynamics as a contributing factor. In an S. cerevisiae protein interaction network we investigate to what extent edges that arise from duplication events contribute to the observed tendency to interact with proteins of a similar age. We find that part of this tendency is explained by interactions between paralogs. Age is usually defined on the level of protein families, rather than individual proteins, hence paralogs have the same age. The major contribution however, is from interaction partners that are shared between paralogs. These interactions have most likely been conserved after a duplication event. To investigate to what extent a nearly neutral process of network growth can explain these results, we adjust a well-studied network growth model to incorporate protein families. Our model shows that the number of edges between paralogs can be amplified by subsequent duplication events, thus explaining the overrepresentation of interparalog edges in the data. The fact that interaction partners shared by paralogs are often of the same age as the paralogs does not arise naturally from our model and needs further investigation.",
    "response": "We amend previous theories that explain why proteins of a similar age prefer to interact by demonstrating that this observation can be partially explained by gene duplication events. There is an ongoing debate on whether the protein interaction network is predominantly shaped by duplication and subfunctionalization or whether network rewiring is most important. Our analyses of S. cerevisiae protein interaction networks demonstrate that duplications have influenced at least one property of the protein interaction network: how proteins of different ages are connected.",

    "context": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), are ubiquitous toxic environmental pollutants capable of inducing cell death. Intracellular pH plays a key role in the regulation of cell survival and death. Our previous works have demonstrated that intracellular alkalinization mediated by Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE-1) is a critical event involved in B[a]P-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the mechanisms of NHE-1 activation upon B[a]P exposure. We tested the effects of plasma membrane cholesterol enrichment or depletion on B[a]P-induced NHE-1 activation related to apoptosis. We isolated cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains to assess NHE-1 submembrane location and immunoprecipitated NHE-1 from the different sub-membrane fractions obtained to examine NHE-1 protein interactions during B[a]P-induced apoptosis. We found that NHE-1 is preferentially located in cholesterol-rich microdomains and that B[a]P activates NHE-1 via its relocation and binding of calmodulin outside these specialized plasma membrane microstructures; these events are necessary for the execution of the apoptosis-related intracellular alkalinization.",

    "context": "Rhodnius prolixus is the main vector of Chagas disease in Venezuela. Here, domestic infestations of poor quality rural housing have persisted despite four decades of vector control. This is in contrast to the Southern Cone region of South America, where the main vector, Triatoma infestans, has been eliminated over large areas. The repeated colonisation of houses by silvatic populations of R. prolixus potentially explains the control difficulties. However, controversy surrounds the existence of silvatic R. prolixus: it has been suggested that all silvatic populations are in fact Rhodnius robustus, a related species of minor epidemiological importance. Here we investigate, by direct sequencing (mtcytb, D2) and by microsatellite analysis, 1) the identity of silvatic Rhodnius and 2) whether silvatic populations of Rhodnius are isolated from domestic populations. Direct sequencing confirmed the presence of R. prolixus in palms and that silvatic bugs can colonise houses, with house and palm specimens sharing seven cytb haplotypes. Additionally, mitochondrial introgression was detected between R. robustus and R. prolixus, indicating a previous hybridisation event. The use of ten polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed a lack of genetic structure between silvatic and domestic ecotopes (non-significant F(ST) values), which is indicative of unrestricted gene flow.",

    "context": "Patients with angioedema experience unpredictable attacks of tissue swelling in which bradykinin is implicated. Several distinct mutations in Factor XII (FXII) are associated with hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the presence of normal C1 esterase inhibitor activity (FXII-HAE). The underlying disease mechanisms are unclear, which complicates diagnosis and treatment. We sought to identify the natural trigger for FXII activation, which causes uncontrolled bradykinin production in patients with FXII-HAE. We generated recombinant variants of FXII, representing health and disease, and studied their behavior in functional studies. We investigated bradykinin-forming pathways in blood plasma with newly developed nanobody-based analytic methods. We here report that FXII-HAE mutations collectively introduce new sites that are sensitive to enzymatic cleavage by plasmin. These FXII mutants rapidly activate after cleavage by plasmin, escape from inhibition through C1 esterase inhibitor, and elicit excessive bradykinin formation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that plasmin modulates disease activity in patients with FXII-HAE. Finally, we show that soluble lysine analogs attenuate this mechanism, explaining their therapeutic value in patients with HAE.",

Interactions between ECs and pericytes via signaling molecules, including angiopoietins, are involved in maintenance of the vascular integrity. Experimental data have shown that enhancement of Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 signaling might be beneficial in renal I/R injury. However, little is known about the role of angiopoietins in human renal I/R injury. In this study, EC activation and changes in angiopoeitins are assessed in human living-donor (LD) and deceased-donor (DD) kidney transplantation. Local release of angiopoietins was measured by unique, dynamic arteriovenous measurements over the reperfused kidney. Renal I/R is associated with acute EC activation shown by a vast Ang-2 release from both LD and DD shortly after reperfusion. Its counterpart Ang-1 was not released. Histologic analysis of kidney biopsies showed EC loss after reperfusion. Baseline protein and mRNA Ang-1 expression was significantly reduced in DD compared with LD and declined further after reperfusion.",

    "context": "Histamine sensitizes the nociceptor transient reporter potential channel V1 (TRPV1) and has been shown to contribute to visceral hypersensitivity in animals. We investigated the role of TRPV1 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and evaluated if an antagonist of histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) could reduce symptoms of patients in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. By using live calcium imaging, we compared activation of submucosal neurons by the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin in rectal biopsy specimens collected from 9 patients with IBS (ROME 3 criteria) and 15 healthy subjects. The sensitization of TRPV1 by histamine, its metabolite imidazole acetaldehyde, and supernatants from biopsy specimens was assessed by calcium imaging of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. We then performed a double-blind trial of patients with IBS (mean age, 31 y; range, 18-65 y; 34 female). After a 2-week run-in period, subjects were assigned randomly to groups given either the HRH1 antagonist ebastine (20 mg/day; n = 28) or placebo (n = 27) for 12 weeks. Rectal biopsy specimens were collected, barostat studies were performed, and symptoms were assessed (using the validated gastrointestinal symptom rating scale) before and after the 12-week period. Patients were followed up for an additional 2 weeks. Abdominal pain, symptom relief, and health-related quality of life were assessed on a weekly basis. The primary end point of the study was the effect of ebastine on the symptom score evoked by rectal distension. TRPV1 responses of submucosal neurons from patients with IBS were potentiated compared with those of healthy volunteers. Moreover, TRPV1 responses of submucosal neurons from healthy volunteers could be potentiated by their pre-incubation with histamine; this effect was blocked by the HRH1 antagonist pyrilamine. Supernatants from rectal biopsy specimens from patients with IBS, but not from the healthy volunteers, sensitized TRPV1 in mouse nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons via HRH1; this effect could be reproduced by histamine and imidazole acetaldehyde. Compared with subjects given placebo, those given ebastine had reduced visceral hypersensitivity, increased symptom relief (ebastine 46% vs placebo 13%; P = .024), and reduced abdominal pain scores (ebastine 39 ± 23 vs placebo 62 ± 22; P = .0004).",

However, the cellular behaviors of cancer cells survived from PDT are still not clear. Previously, we have found that PDT-derived variants A375/3A5 and A375/6A5 have reduced invasion ability. This study attempted to further elucidate the possible molecules associated with the altered invasiveness in the PDT-derived variants and cancer cells treated with PDT. Scratch wound healing assay and invasion assay were performed to evaluate the migration and invasion ability of human A375 melanoma and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells. Single colony selection and microarray analysis were performed to examine the differentially expressed transcripts in parental A375 and PDT-derived variants. RT-PCR and Western blots analysis were performed to examine the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4). The MMP9 activity was examined by Zymography assay. CLIC4 expressing construct was used to examine the influence on MMP9 expression and invasion ability of cancer cells treated with PDT. Correlated with the reduced invasiveness, we found that A375/3A5 and A375/6A5 cells have decreased production of MMP9. Microarray analysis and RT-PCR showed CLIC4 was down-regulated in the PDT-derived variants. Furthermore, down-regulation of CLIC4 and MMP9 was found in cancer cells treated with PDT. Transfection of surviving cancer cells with a plasmid vector encoding CLIC4 increased MMP9 expression and cell invasion.

    "context": "Patients with malignant glioma suffer global compromise of their cellular immunity, characterized by dramatic reductions in CD4(+) T cell numbers and function. We have previously shown that increased regulatory T cell (T(reg)) fractions in these patients explain T-cell functional deficits. Our murine glioma model recapitulates these findings. Here, we investigate the effects of systemic CTLA-4 blockade in this model. A monoclonal antibody (9H10) to CTLA-4 was employed against well-established glioma. Survival and risks for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis were assessed, as were CD4(+) T cell numbers and function in the peripheral blood, spleen, and cervical lymph nodes. The specific capacities for anti-CTLA-4 to modify the functions of regulatory versus CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells were evaluated. CTLA-4 blockade confers long-term survival in 80% of treated mice, without eliciting experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Changes to the CD4 compartment were reversed, as anti-CTLA-4 reestablishes normal CD4 counts and abrogates increases in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)GITR(+) regulatory T cell fraction observed in tumor-bearing mice. CD4(+) T-cell proliferative capacity is restored and the cervical lymph node antitumor response is enhanced. Treatment benefits are bestowed exclusively on the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell population and not T(regs), as CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells from treated mice show improved proliferative responses and resistance to T(reg)-mediated suppression, whereas T(regs) from the same mice remain anergic and exhibit no restriction of their suppressive capacity.",

Despite recent success in improving anti-HCV therapy, additional progress is still needed to develop cheaper and interferon (IFN)-free treatments. Here, we report that ferroquine (FQ), an antimalarial ferrocenic analog of chloroquine, is a novel inhibitor of HCV. FQ potently inhibited HCV infection of hepatoma cell lines by affecting an early step of the viral life cycle. The antiviral activity of FQ on HCV entry was confirmed with pseudoparticles expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 from six different genotypes. In addition to its effect on HCV entry, FQ also inhibited HCV RNA replication, albeit at a higher concentration. We also showed that FQ has no effect on viral assembly and virion secretion. Using a binding assay at 4°C, we showed that FQ does not prevent attachment of the virus to the cell surface. Furthermore, virus internalization was not affected by FQ, whereas the fusion process was impaired in the presence of FQ as shown in a cell-cell fusion assay. Finally, virus with resistance to FQ was selected by sequential passage in the presence of the drug, and resistance was shown to be conferred by a single mutation in E1 glycoprotein (S327A). By inhibiting cell-free virus transmission using a neutralizing antibody, we also showed that FQ inhibits HCV cell-to-cell spread between neighboring cells.

New data, however, suggest that it may be time to revisit this estimate. We estimated total iron bioavailability from the US diet with the use of our recently reported algorithm that estimates nonheme iron absorption and a conservative value for heme iron absorption. We used dietary intake and biomarker information from the NHANES 2001-2002, MyPyramid Equivalents Database, and Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. The survey package in R software was used to estimate means and CIs, taking into account the strata, primary sampling units, and appropriate survey weight. We implemented 2 different approaches to estimate total iron absorption. In the first approach, we included all survey participants but adjusted the geometric mean of nonheme iron absorption to 15 μg ferritin/L serum to mimic values of individuals with no iron stores; in the second approach, absorption was estimated for only nonanemic subjects with no iron stores. A total sample size of 6631 was used based on availability of dietary and iron status biomarker data and C-reactive protein concentration ≤ 6 mg/L. The geometric mean (95% CI) of unadjusted nonheme iron absorption for all subjects was 3.7% (3.6%, 3.8%), higher in female subjects [5.6% (5.4%, 5.7%)] than male subjects [2.6% (2.5%, 2.7%)] (P < 0.0001).

However, resistance to erlotinib is a major clinical problem. Earlier we have demonstrated the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cells, leading to increased proliferation and invasion. Here, we investigated the role of Hh signaling in erlotinib resistance of TGF-β1-induced NSCLC cells that are reminiscent of EMT cells. Hh signaling was inhibited by specific siRNA and by GDC-0449, a small molecule antagonist of G protein coupled receptor smoothened in the Hh pathway. Not all NSCLC patients are likely to benefit from EGFR-TKIs and, therefore, cisplatin was used to further demonstrate a role of inhibition of Hh signaling in sensitization of resistant EMT cells. Specific pre- and anti-miRNA preparations were used to study the mechanistic involvement of miRNAs in drug resistance mechanism. siRNA-mediated inhibition as well as pharmacological inhibition of Hh signaling abrogated resistance of NSCLC cells to erlotinib and cisplatin. It also resulted in re-sensitization of TGF-β1-induced A549 (A549M) cells as well the mesenchymal phenotypic H1299 cells to erlotinib and cisplatin treatment with concomitant up-regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (Sox2, Nanog and EpCAM) and down-regulation of miR-200 and let-7 family miRNAs. Ectopic up-regulation of miRNAs, especially miR-200b and let-7c, significantly diminished the erlotinib resistance of A549M cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling by GDC-0449 in EMT cells resulted in the attenuation of CSC markers and up-regulation of miR-200b and let-7c, leading to sensitization of EMT cells to drug treatment, thus, confirming a connection between Hh signaling, miRNAs and drug resistance.",

    "instruction": "Is aberrant promoter methylation of CDH13 and MGMT genes associated with clinicopathologic characteristics of primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma?",
    "context": "Non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (n = 65) were analyzed for promoter methylation of RASSF1A, CDH13, MGMT, ESR1, and DAPK genes in matching lung tumors, normal lung tissue, and blood samples. Aberrant methylation in CDH13 and MGMT was associated with clinicopathologic features of NSCLC. Hypermethylation detected in primary tumors was not observed in corresponding blood samples, which rendered this an unsuitable blood-based test for NSCLC detection. Systemic methylation changes may be a diagnostic marker for tumor development or prognosis. Here, we investigate the relationship between gene methylation in lung tumors relative to normal lung tissue and whether DNA methylation changes can be detected in paired blood samples. Sixty-five patients were enrolled in a surgical case series of non-small-cell lung carcinoma at a single institution. By using bisulfite pyrosequencing, CpG methylation was quantified at 5 genes (RASSF1A, CDH13, MGMT, ESR1, and DAPK) in lung tumor, pathologically normal lung tissue, and circulating blood from enrolled cases. The analyses of methylation in tumors compared with normal lung tissue identified higher methylation of CDH13, RASSF1A, and DAPK genes, whereas ESR1 and MGMT methylation did not differ significantly between these tissue types. We then examined whether the 3 aberrantly methylated genes could be detected in blood. The difference in methylation observed in tumors was not reflected in methylation status of matching blood samples, which indicated a low feasibility of detecting lung cancer by analyzing these genes in a blood-based test. Lastly, we probed whether tumor methylation was associated with clinical and demographic characteristics. Histology and sex were associated with methylation at the CDH13 gene, whereas, stage was associated with methylation at MGMT.",
    "response": "Our results showed higher methylation of RASSF1A, CDH13, and DAPK genes in lung tumors compared with normal lung.

We aimed to assess whether the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation, an acquired mutation that occurs in MPD patients, is a risk factor for portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) independently of the presence of overt MPDs. The medical histories of 99 patients presenting with PMVT were obtained. The presence of the JAK2 V617F and VHL 598C > T mutations was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis and direct cycle sequence analysis. Over a 10-year period of observation, of the 99 patients presenting with PMVT, the JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in heterozygous state in 17 individuals [17.2%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 10.9-25.9].

    "context": "Gefitinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Continuous inhibition of EGFR signaling is thought necessary for optimal inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. We hypothesized that continuous gefitinib may antagonize the effects of cytotoxics that inhibit tumor cells in other phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we hypothesized that intermittent dosing would allow for dose escalation and greater inhibition of EGFR-dependent antiapoptotic pathways. To test these assertions, we compared combinations of paclitaxel and gefitinib using either intermittent or continuous dosing schedules in mice. We found that when used in combination with paclitaxel, pulsatile gefitinib was significantly superior to continuous dosing. When gefitinib was administered for one or two consecutive days before paclitaxel, much higher doses could be given safely. Two days of gefitinib treatment before paclitaxel was most effective, causing significantly greater mean tumor regression and a higher percentage of complete responses than other schedules.",
    "response": "The results suggest that the dose and schedule of an EGFR inhibitor required to effectively inhibit proliferation may differ from that required to stimulate apoptosis or to induce other effects. The former may require continuous EGFR inhibition to maintain cell cycle arrest, whereas sensitization to apoptosis may be optimally induced by profound but temporary inhibition of survival pathways. Our data suggest that the effects of receptor inhibition vary as a function of dose and schedule and that continuous administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors may not be the best schedule with which to combine such agents with taxanes.",

    "context": "This study aimed to identify microRNAs as novel biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. microRNAs may have a general role by acting as superordinated key regulators of tumorigenesis. Individual cellular molecules of multiple pathways associated with pancreatic cancer were analyzed for common microRNA binding sites, thereby enabling the identification of key regulating microRNAs. The potential of the identified microRNAs was subsequently determined in cell culture experiments. Using bioinformatic pathway analyses, miR-548d was identified to target multiple components of pancreatic cancer-related pathways. The effect of microRNA on pancreatic cells was determined by overexpression studies using PANC-1 cells, resulting in impaired cell proliferation because of increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. In addition, miR-548d overexpression led to a sensitization to gemcitabine.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the association of early weaning with the occurrence of atopic dermatitis (AD). We conducted a matched case-control study on incident physician-diagnosed AD in early childhood including 451 cases and 451 controls. Data on several factors, including feeding practices, were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models, conditioned on study center, age, sex, and period of interview, and adjusted for potential confounders. Early weaning, defined as the introduction of solid foods at 4 or 5 months of age, was inversely related to the risk of AD, with children weaned at 4 months having lower AD risk (OR = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.20-0.87) compared to those exclusively breastfed. Similar results were observed for weaning started at 5 months of age (OR = 0.39, 95% CI, 0.18-0.83). This association persisted when children with and without family history of allergy were considered separately. Prolonged partial breastfeeding (breastmilk plus milk formulas) was not associated with AD. Consistently, the introduction of a high number of different solid foods reduced the risk of AD (P trend = 0.02 at 4 months of age and P trend = 0.04 at 5 months).",

However, research on the relationship between AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques is still insufficient. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the adaptive mechanism between autophagy of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) and the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. We investigated whether AMPK and autophagy of monocytes can enhance the stability of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the human body. Samples of PBMs were collected and isolated from all patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP), non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, and without coronary artery disease (control). Then, western blot was used to detect the expression levels of AMPK and autophagy-related protein. The expression levels of beclin-1 and ATG7 were all significantly lower in the acute coronary syndrome groups than those in the SAP and control groups (all P<0.01). The level of phosphorylated AMPK was significantly decreased in patients with acute coronary syndrome compared with those in the SAP and control groups (P<0.01). However, there was no statistical difference between the SAP group and the control group. The activation of mTOR was distinctly increased in the STEMI group (P<0.05).",

Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) show such properties. Moreover, they contribute to stress tolerance in plants, acting as putative membrane stabilizers, antioxidants and signalling agents. A large-scale soluble carbohydrate screening was performed within the plant kingdom. An unknown compound accumulated to a high extent in early-spring red deadnettle (Lamium purpureum) but not in other RFO plants. The compound was purified and its structure was unravelled with NMR. Organs and organ parts of red deadnettle were carefully dissected and analysed for soluble sugars. Phloem sap content was analysed by a common EDTA-based method. Early-spring red deadnettle stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisaccharide manninotriose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glcα1,2βFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections, together with phloem sap analyses, strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbohydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in red deadnettle are discussed.",
    "response": "It is demonstrated for the first time that manninotriose is a novel and important player in the RFO metabolism of red dead deadnettle. It is proposed that manninotriose represents a temporary storage carbohydrate in early-spring deadnettle, at the same time perhaps functioning as a membrane protector and/or as an antioxidant in the vicinity of membranes, as recently suggested for other RFOs and fructans. This novel finding urges further research on this peculiar carbohydrate on a broader array of RFO accumulators.",

    "context": "Human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has been widely explored as a gene delivery vector for a variety of diseases. Many target cells, however, express low levels of Ad5 native receptor, the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), and thus are resistant to Ad5 infection. The Protein Transduction Domain of the HIV Tat protein, namely PTD tat, has been shown to mediate protein transduction in a wide range of cells. We hypothesize that re-targeting Ad5 vector via the PTD tat motif would improve the efficacy of Ad5-mediated gene delivery. In this study, we genetically incorporated the PTD tat motif into the knob domain of Ad5 fiber, and rescued the resultant viral vector, Ad5.PTD tat. Our data showed the modification did not interfere with Ad5 binding to its native receptor CAR, suggesting Ad5 infection via the CAR pathway is retained. In addition, we found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy in all of the cell lines that we have tested, which included both low-CAR and high-CAR decorated cells. Competitive inhibition assays suggested the enhanced infectivity of Ad5.PTD tat was mediated by binding of the positively charged PTD tat peptide to the negatively charged epitopes on the cells' surface. Furthermore, we investigated in vivo gene delivery efficacy of Ad5.PTD tat using subcutaneous tumor models established with U118MG glioma cells, and found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy compared to unmodified Ad5 vector as analyzed by a non-invasive fluorescence imaging technique.",

Chronic alcohol feeding significantly reduced visceral fat mass and down-regulated peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, 2 important transcription factors in regulation of lipogenesis. The protein levels of lipogenic enzymes including phospho-ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, lipin1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in the visceral fat were reduced. In contrast, chronic alcohol exposure did not affect subcutaneous fat mass and had less effect on the protein levels of lipogenic enzymes and regulators.

To determine if depletion of lysozyme M increases a susceptibility to pneumococal otitis media, 50 CFU of S. pneumoniae 6B were transtympanically inoculated to the middle ear and viable bacteria were counted at day 3 and 7 with clinical grading of middle ear inflammation. Immunolabeling revealed that localization of lysozyme M and lysozyme P is specific to some/particular cell types of the Eustachian tube. Lysozyme P of lysozyme M-/- mice was mainly expressed in the submucosal gland but not in the tubal epithelium. Although lysozyme M-/- mice showed compensatory up-regulation of lysozyme P, lysozyme M depletion resulted in a decrease in both muramidase and antimicrobial activities. Deficiency in lysozyme M led to an increased susceptibility to middle ear infection with S. pneumoniae 6B and resulted in severe middle ear inflammation, compared to wild type mice.",
    "response": "The results suggest that lysozyme M plays an important role in protecting the middle ear from invading pathogens, particularly in the early phase. We suggest a possibility of the exogenous lysozyme as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for otitis media, but further studies are necessary.",

    "instruction": "Are neutrophils primed for cytotoxicity and resist apoptosis in injured patients at risk for multiple organ failure?",
    "context": "Postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF) is the result of a dysregulated systemic inflammatory response in which primed neutrophils (PMNs) are sequestered in tissues, vulnerable to activation through secondary insults. Apoptosis is critical to the normal clearance of these sequestered PMNs. Conversely, dysfunctional apoptosis prolongs the PMN functional life span, potentially exacerbating PMN-mediated tissue injury and the development of MOF. We hypothesized that severe trauma, in addition to priming PMNs, provokes dysfunctional PMN apoptosis. Neutrophils were harvested daily from 12 severely injured patients at high risk for MOF, cultured for 24 hours, and assessed for apoptosis with use of acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining and fluorescence microscopy. Priming for elastase release was measured in freshly isolated patient PMNs. Plasma from patients was assessed for its ability to delay apoptosis of normal PMNs. Four patients (33%) had MOF. Neutrophil apoptosis was profoundly delayed in severely injured patients throughout the 5-day study period. Priming for elastase release was augmented concomitantly. Patients' plasma delayed apoptosis of normal PMNs.",
    "response": "In patients at high risk for postinjury MOF, PMNs are not only primed for cytotoxicity but also resist apoptosis. The dysfunctional apoptosis is attributed, at least in part, to a plasma-borne mediator. The net effect may facilitate hyperinflammatory organ injury.",

    "context": "Transient hyperthermic shifts in body temperature have been linked to the endogenous hormone calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which can increase sympathetic activation and metabolic heat production. Recent studies have demonstrated that these centrally mediated responses may result from CGRP dependent changes in the activity of thermoregulatory neurons in the preoptic and anterior regions of the hypothalamus (POAH). Using a tissue slice preparation, we recorded the single-unit activity of POAH neurons from the adult male rat, in response to temperature and CGRP (10 muM). Based on the slope of firing rate as a function of temperature, neurons were classified as either warm sensitive or temperature insensitive. All warm sensitive neurons responded to CGRP with a significant decrease in firing rate. While CGRP did not alter the firing rates of some temperature insensitive neurons, responsive neurons showed an increase in firing rate.",
    "response": "With respect to current models of thermoregulatory control, these CGRP dependent changes in firing rate would result in hyperthermia. This suggests that both warm sensitive and temperature insensitive neurons in the POAH may play a role in producing this hyperthermic shift in temperature.",

But the mechanism has not been clarified yet. There are few reports about the treatment of endometrial carcinoma using GnRH-I agonists. Type II GnRH (GnRH-II) is a new subtype of GnRH. Our aim was to investigate the effects of GnRH-I agonists and GnRH-II on estrogen receptor-negative human endometrial carcinoma cells and the effect from phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) to them. A lentiviral vector-mediated RNAi method was used to establish a PTEN-negative HEC-1A cell clone (HEC-1A-ND). MTT and flow cytometry were used to detect the cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-NC and HEC-1A-ND cells after treatment with GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L) or GnRH-II (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L). Western blotting was used to detect AKT and ERK1/2 activation after treatment with different concentrations of Triptorelin or GnRH-II for 30 minutes in the above mentioned three kinds of cells. Triptorelin and GnRH-II induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-ND and HEC-1A-NC in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was augmented in HEC-1A-ND cells in which PTEN gene was knocked-down. Furthermore, Triptorelin and GnRH-II inhibited the AKT and ERK activity in HEC-1A-ND cells.",

In this study, we attempted to explore the role of p-smad3L in the expression of fascin induced by TGF-β in gastric cancer cells. Pseudopodia were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Fascin expression was detected by RT-PCR and western blot. Smad3 siRNA was used to repress the endogenous smad3. The phosphorylations of smad3 linker region at sites s204, s208 and s213 were detected by western blot. The fascin promoter reporter activity was measured by dual luciferase assay. TGF-β could increase the formation of pseudopodia and the expression of fascin in gastric cancer cells. Smad3 depletion abrogated the expression of fascin induced by TGF-β. The phosphorylation of smad3 linker region at serine 204, 208 and 213 was enhanced in gastric cancer cells after TGF-β treatment. The fascin promoter reporter activity was significantly enhanced with TGF-β treatment in both wild-type Smad3 group and Smad3EPSM group (P<0.05).

Overall, homosexually experienced women are more likely than exclusively heterosexually experienced women to currently smoke and to evidence higher levels of alcohol consumption, both in frequency and quantity. Focusing on age cohorts, the greatest sexual orientation disparity in alcohol use patterns appears clustered among women in the 26-35-year-old group.

However, little is known of the receptor systems within this nucleus which might be involved. Furthermore, some research suggests that the PPTg may also be part of the neuronal circuitry involved in established drug-taking behavior. The objective of these experiments was to examine the role of mu-opioid and nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms in the PPTg in cocaine self-administration. Microinfusions of mu-opioid and nicotinic receptor selective compounds were made into the PPTg of rats trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously, in the vicinity of cholinergic cells which are known to project to the midbrain dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The mu-opioid selective agonist DAMGO, tested at doses of 0, 0.05 and 0.5 microg, produced a dose-related reduction in the number of cocaine infusions obtained during the 1-h self-administration sessions. The mu-selective antagonist CTOP (0-2 microg) and nicotine (0-10 microg) did not produce significant changes in cocaine self-administration. Microinfusions of the nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (0-30 microg) produced a small but significant increase in cocaine-maintained responding.",

Currently, there is no method to predict which patients are at greatest risk. This study was designed to determine whether serum lactate, measured at the time of FN, is associated with the development of septic shock in hospitalized hematologic malignancy (HM) patients. Of the 547 patients enrolled, 46 (8.4%; 95% CI 6.2-10.9) developed septic shock. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. In univariate analysis, tachypnea (OR 5.9; 95% CI: 2.0-16.9, p = 0.001) and lactate (OR 18.4; 95% CI: 4.1-81.6, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the development of septic shock. In multivariate analysis, lactate and tachypnea remained independently associated with the development of septic shock. By ROC analysis, lactate provided incremental prognostic value compared to vital signs alone. Vital signs and lactate were measured during episodes of FN. The primary endpoint was the development of septic shock. Using a prospective, nested, case-control design, controls were matched on length of stay at the time of septic shock to achieve 80% power to detect an OR of >or=2.5. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the association of vital signs and lactate with the subsequent development of septic shock.",

We aimed to study the impact of graft quality on clinical outcome and identify factors affecting graft quality. We investigated the influence of graft quality on the clinical outcome in 144 HSCT patients. Graft quality was assessed by determining the viability (7-aminoactinomycin D [7AAD]) on a frozen-thawed sample from the peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. Patients receiving PBSCs with inferior quality (i.e., viability < 64% in the frozen-thawed sample) more frequently developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) Grades I to IV than patients receiving grafts with better quality (p = 0.025). The transplant-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the group receiving grafts with lower viability (p = 0.03). The viability of the frozen-thawed samples was highly variable (median, 64%; range, 24%-96%). No correlation could be observed when comparing the viability in newly arrived PBSC grafts to frozen-thawed vials.

Laparoscopic insufflation was modeled in mice along with anesthesia and ventilation. Entry and exit ports were introduced to maintain insufflation using dry-cold or humidified-warm CO2 with a constant flow and pressure for 1 h; then 1000 or 1 million fluorescent-tagged murine colorectal cancer cells (CT26) were delivered into the peritoneal cavity.

Monocrotaline induced the development of progressive pulmonary hypertension. sEH inhibition increased the plasma ratio of EETs to DHETs and attenuated the monocrotaline-induced increase in pulmonary artery medial wall thickness as well as the degree of vascular muscularization. Moreover, right ventricular pressure was significantly lower in the group treated with sEH inhibitors. Pulmonary sEH protein expression and sEH activity, as well as pulmonary cytochrome P450 epoxygenase activity were all impaired in monocrotaline-treated rats as compared with control animals. sEH inhibitors, however, increased the plasma ratio of EETs to dihydroxy epoxyeicosatrienoic acids.

    "context": "The protumorigenic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II is highly expressed in a significant fraction of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, a functional dissection that clarifies the contribution of IGF-II-binding receptors in tumor progression and a respective molecular characterization of IGF-II signaling has not been performed. Therefore, expression of IGF-II and its receptors IGF-receptor type I (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (IR) was efficiently blocked using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HCC cells. Despite functional IR-signaling, oncogenic IGF-II effects such as tumor cell viability, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis were solely transmitted by IGF-IR. Although IGF-II signaling was previously not described in the context of HCC cell migration, the IGF-II-dependent expression profile displayed a high percentage of genes involved in cell motility and adhesion. Indeed, IGF-II overexpression promoted HCC cell migration, especially in synergy with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The therapeutic relevance of IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling was tested in vitro and in a murine xenograft transplantation model using the IGF-IR inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP). IGF-IR inhibition by small molecule treatment efficiently reduced IGF-II-dependent signaling and all protumorigenic properties of the IGF-II/IGF-IR pathway.",
    "response": "In human HCC cells, IGF-IR but not IR is involved in oncogenic IGF-II signaling. Autocrine stimulation of IGF-II induces HCC motility by integration of paracrine signals for full malignant competence. Thus, activation of IGF-II/IGF-IR signaling is likely a progression switch selected by function that promotes tumor cell dissemination and aggressive tumor behavior.",

    "context": "We recently introduced a technique of sutureless, mesh-based pneumostasis for preventing alveolar air leaks after lung resection. To verify the clinical usefulness of this technique, we examined if it can contribute to preserving gas exchange capacity and promoting postoperative rehabilitation. We prospectively collected perioperative data, including arterial oxygen saturation on postoperative day (POD) 1 and the length of postoperative rehabilitation in 100 patients undergoing elective, video-assisted major lung resection for cancer. Before April, 2006, intraoperative air leaks were sealed with the conventional method (control group), and thereafter, with bioabsorbable mesh and glue, without suturing, (treated group). To reduce the bias in comparison of the nonrandomized control group, we paired the treated group with the control group using the nearest available matching method on the estimated propensity score. Thirty-five patients in the control group were matched to 35 patients in the treated group based on the estimated propensity score. The length of both chest tube drainage and postoperative rehabilitation were significantly shorter in the treated group than in the control group (median, 1 versus 1 d, P = 0.03; 2 versus 3 d, P = 0.01, respectively). The arterial oxygen saturation on POD 1 was significantly higher in the treated group than in the control group (median, 94.0 versus 92.5 %, P = 0.03).",

However, the enumeration of EVs faces major problems, due to their sub-micrometer size and to intrinsic limitations in methods of characterization, mainly flow cytometry (FCM). Our objective is to enumerate EVs in plasma, by taking as the prototype the population of phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposing EVs, which constitute one of the major EV populations and are responsible for thrombotic disorders. The concentration of PS-exposing EVs in platelet-free plasma (PFP) of healthy subjects was measured by FCM using either light scattering or fluorescence as the trigger and fluorescent Annexin-5 (Anx5) as the specific label. In addition, PS-exposing EVs were enumerated by electron microscopy (EM) after labeling with Anx5 gold nanoparticles and sedimentation on EM grids. We show that about 50× more Anx5-positive EVs are detected by FCM when detection is triggered on fluorescence as compared with light scattering. By fluorescence triggering, concentrations of 22 000-30 000 Anx5-positive EVs per μL PFP were determined, using two different flow cytometers. The limit of detection of the fluorescence triggering method was estimated at about 1000-2500 Anx5 molecules. Results from EM suggest that EVs down to 100-150 nm diameter are detected by fluorescence triggering.",

By measuring the rate of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, we found that the absence of p53 in macrophages stimulates cellular proliferation. In contrast, the rate of apoptosis in the atheromatous lesion was similar in the two groups of mice. Furthermore, we found that the absence of macrophage-specific p53 expression was associated with vulnerable-appearing lesions marked by increased tissue necrosis and reduced collagen deposition.",

To determine whether Ang II was sufficient to provoke TNF biosynthesis in the adult heart, we examined the effects of Ang II in isolated buffer-perfused Langendorff feline hearts. Ang II (10(-7) mol/L) treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in myocardial TNF mRNA and protein biosynthesis in the heart as well as in cultured adult cardiac myocytes. The effects of Ang II on myocardial TNF mRNA and protein synthesis were mediated through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), insofar as an AT1R antagonist (AT1a) blocked the effects of Ang II, whereas an angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) antagonist (AT2a) had no effect. Stimulation with Ang II led to the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), two transcription factors that are important for TNF gene expression. Nuclear factor-kappaB activation was accompanied by phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha on serine 32 as well as degradation of IkappaBalpha, suggesting that the effects of Ang II were mediated through an IkappaBalpha-dependent pathway. The important role of protein kinase C (PKC) was suggested by studies in which a phorbol ester triggered TNF biosynthesis, and a PKC inhibitor abrogated Ang II-induced TNF biosynthesis.",

These effects are hypothesized to result from polyphenol-mediated alterations in cellular eicosanoid synthesis. The objective was to determine and compare the ability of cocoa procyanidins to alter eicosanoid synthesis in human subjects and cultured human aortic endothelial cells. After an overnight fast, 10 healthy subjects (4 men and 6 women) consumed 37 g low-procyanidin (0.09 mg/g) and high-procyanidin (4.0 mg/g) chocolate; the treatments were separated by 1 wk. The investigation had a randomized, blinded, crossover design. Plasma samples were collected before treatment and 2 and 6 h after treatment. Eicosanoids were quantitated by enzyme immunoassay. Endothelial cells were treated in vitro with procyanidins to determine whether the effects of procyanidin in vivo were associated with procyanidin-induced alterations in endothelial cell eicosanoid synthesis. Relative to the effects of the low-procyanidin chocolate, high-procyanidin chocolate induced increases in plasma prostacyclin (32%; P<0.05) and decreases in plasma leukotrienes (29%; P<0.04). After the in vitro procyanidin treatments, aortic endothelial cells synthesized twice as much 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (P<0.01) and 16% less leukotriene (P<0.05) as did control cells.

In a series of experiments examining different EtOH doses (1, 2 g/kg) and ALLOP administration times, ALLOP (0, 3.2, 10, 17 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered four times with EtOH prior to placement on a distinctive floor (CS+). On alternate days, vehicle was administered prior to a saline injection paired with the other floor stimulus (CS-). In a separate experiment, finasteride (0, 50, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor that blocks ALLOP synthesis, was administered prior to both CS+ and CS- trials. In a final experiment, animals were place conditioned to EtOH alone, and ALLOP (0, 3.2, 10, 17 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered prior to the preference test only. During conditioning, ALLOP increased and finasteride decreased EtOH-stimulated activity compared with vehicle pretreatment.

Tic110 forms one prominent protein translocation channel. Additionally, Tic20, another subunit of the complex, was proposed to form a protein import channel - either together with or independent of Tic110. However, no experimental evidence for Tic20 channel activity has been provided so far. We performed a comprehensive biochemical and electrophysiological study to characterize Tic20 in more detail and to gain a deeper insight into its potential role in protein import into chloroplasts. Firstly, we compared transcript and protein levels of Tic20 and Tic110 in both Pisum sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found the Tic20 protein to be generally less abundant, which was particularly pronounced in Arabidopsis. Secondly, we demonstrated that Tic20 forms a complex larger than 700 kilodalton in the inner envelope membrane, which is clearly separate from Tic110, migrating as a dimer at about 250 kilodalton. Thirdly, we defined the topology of Tic20 in the inner envelope, and found its N- and C-termini to be oriented towards the stromal side. Finally, we successfully reconstituted overexpressed and purified full-length Tic20 into liposomes. Using these Tic20-proteoliposomes, we could demonstrate for the first time that Tic20 can independently form a cation selective channel in vitro.",
    "response": "The presented data provide first biochemical evidence to the notion that Tic20 can act as a channel protein within the chloroplast import translocon complex. However, the very low abundance of Tic20 in the inner envelope membranes indicates that it cannot form a major protein translocation channel. Furthermore, the independent complex formation of Tic20 and Tic110 argues against a joint channel formation. Thus, based on the observed channel activity of Tic20 in proteoliposomes, we speculate that the chloroplast inner envelope contains multiple (at least two) translocation channels: Tic110 as the general translocation pore, whereas Tic20 could be responsible for translocation of a special subset of proteins.",

    "context": "Thiamine deficiency is a condition that is known to cause damage to the nervous and cardiovascular systems because it interferes with cellular metabolism. It is well known that the control of vascular function is highly dependent on the production of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthases. Studies exploring the physiological relevance of NO signaling under conditions of thiamine deficiency are scarce. The present study sought to investigate whether chronic metabolic changes would cause alterations in vascular responsiveness. By removing thiamine from the diet, we observed a reduced acetylcholine-mediated relaxation and an increased phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aortas containing functional endothelium. Removal of the endothelium or the pre-treatment of vessels with l-NAME restored the contractile responses to the level of controls. Conversely, indomethacin did not modify phenylephrine-mediated contractions. We also used carbon microsensors to continually measure NO production in situ while simultaneously measuring the vascular tone. The results revealed a significant decrease in NO production. Western blot analysis showed a decreased expression of the total eNOS in the thiamine-deficient aorta compared to the control. Concentration-response curves for phenylephrine indicated no difference between the control and deficient groups in the presence and absence of SOD or Tyron. The NO donor DEA-NONOate produced a concentration-dependent relaxation response in the endothelium-denuded vessels that did not differ between the control and thiamine-deficient rats.",

Both strains had similar numbers of infiltrating neutrophils in ulcerated areas of the colon after a single DSS cycle, but FPR1(-/-) mice had significantly more neutrophils in the ulcerated mucosa after two cycles. There was no difference in the capacity of neutrophils from each strain to migrate to chemoattractants.

Following acquisition of stable performance, rats were exposed to cocaine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) every other day for 14 days and locomotor activity was measured. Two days later, delay-discounting performance was re-evaluated. To assess reversal of impulsivity, injections of a CB1R antagonist (1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle were given 30 minutes before the task. During the second experiment, aimed at preventing impulsivity rather than reversing it, CB1Rs were antagonized before each cocaine injection. In this experiment, subsecond dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens during delay-discounting sessions before and after cocaine treatment. Blockade of CB1Rs reversed and prevented cocaine-induced impulsivity. Electrochemical results showed that during baseline and following disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, there was a robust increase in dopamine for immediate large rewards compared with immediate small rewards, but this effect reversed when the delay for the large reward was 10 seconds. In contrast, dopamine release always increased for one-pellet options at minimal or moderate delays in vehicle-treated rats.",

In visual search experiments, subjects found a modulating visual target vastly more efficiently when it was paired with a synchronous auditory signal. By manipulating the kind of temporal modulation (sine wave vs. square wave vs. difference wave; harmonic sine-wave synthesis; gradient of onset/offset ramps) we show that abrupt visual events are required for this search efficiency to occur, and that sinusoidal audiovisual modulations do not support efficient search.",

Few studies have addressed the importance of Arg supplementation on macrophage and neutrophil function after infection and sepsis. This study examined the effect of Arg-supplemented diets before and Arg-enriched total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after sepsis or both on the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and blood polymorphonuclear cells in rats with gut-derived sepsis. Male Wistar rats were assigned to 4 groups. Groups 1 and 2 were fed a semipurified diet, while groups 3 and 4 had part of the casein replaced with 2% of total calories as Arg. After the experimental diets were administered for 10 days, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); at the same time, an internal jugular vein was cannulated. All rats were maintained on TPN for 3 days. Groups 1 and 3 were infused with conventional TPN, while groups 2 and 4 were supplemented with Arg, replacing 10% of total amino acids in the TPN solution. Survival rates were recorded for 3 days after CLP, and all surviving rats were killed 3 days after CLP to examine their immune responses. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria colony counts in peritoneal lavage fluid were significantly reduced, and the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was enhanced in groups 3 and 4 but not in the other 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the phagocytic activities of blood polymorphonuclear cells and survival rates among the 4 groups.",
    "response": "Enteral Arg supplementation before sepsis significantly enhanced peritoneal macrophage phagocytic activity and reduced total bacterial counts in peritoneal lavage fluid. Arg administered before and after CLP seemed to have a synergistic effect on enhancing phagocytic activity and on bacterial clearance. However, IV Arg administration after CLP had no favorable effects on phagocytic activity or survival rates in rats with gut-derived sepsis.",

We hypothesized that outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the United States is dependent on primary payer status. From 2003 to 2007, 1,250,619 isolated CABG operations were evaluated using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Patients were stratified by primary payer status: Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, and private insurance. Hierarchical multiple regression models were applied to assess the effect of primary payer status on postoperative outcomes. Unadjusted mortality for Medicare (3.3%), Medicaid (2.4%), and uninsured (1.9%) patients were higher compared with private insurance patients (1.1%, P<0.001). Unadjusted length of stay was longest for Medicaid patients (10.9 ± 0.04 days) and shortest for private insurance patients (8.0 ± 0.01 days, P<0.001). Medicaid patients accrued the highest unadjusted total costs ($113 380 ± 386, P<0.001). Importantly, after controlling for patient risk factors, income, hospital features, and operative volume, Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.82; P<0.001) and uninsured (odds ratio, 1.62; P<0.001) payer status independently conferred the highest adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality. In addition, Medicaid payer status was associated with the longest adjusted length of stay and highest adjusted total costs (P<0.001).",

Whether people with different genotypes are with different susceptibility to these chemicals are unknown. In a group of people highly exposed to PCBs/PCDFs, we tested the hypothesis that genotypic polymorphisms affected susceptibility for development of skin manifestations. In 1979, approximately 2000 people in central Taiwan ingested cooking oil contaminated with PCBs/PCDFs. Skin disorder such as chloracne, abnormal nail, hyperkeratosis and skin allergy were found in PCBs/PCDFs exposed group. We recruited exposed and community background exposure subjects for blood testing and telephone-interview. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, AhR Arg554Lys, CYP1A1 Ile462Val, CYP1A1 T6235C, and GSTM1/T1 deletion, were determined. Occurrence of skin manifestations was compared among people with different genotypes while stratified by PCB exposure levels by logistic regression. Data on exposure, medical history, and genotypes were obtained from 393 exposed and 181 background exposure groups. Skin manifestations including chloracne, allergy, abnormal nail, and hyperkeratosis were more prevalent in exposed people in a dose-related manner. Among highly exposed individuals, combined CYP1A1-MspI mutant genotype and GSTM1-null genotype were associated with increased risk of chloracne (odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-7.6).

Recent studies indicate that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a major chemokine that promotes monocyte infiltration into adipose tissues; however, the adhesion pathway in adipose tissues remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the adhesion molecules that mediate monocyte infiltration into adipose tissue. We used a DNA microarray to compare the gene expression profiles in epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) between db/db mice and C57/BL6 mice each fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a low-fat diet (LFD). We investigated the change of insulin resistance and inflammation in eWAT in P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) homozygous knockout (PSGL-1⁻(/)⁻) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice fed HFD. DNA microarray analysis revealed that PSGL-1, a major ligand for selectins, is upregulated in eWAT from both db/db mice and WT mice fed HFD. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that PSGL-1 is expressed on both endothelial cells and macrophages in eWAT of obese mice. PSGL-1⁻(/)⁻ mice fed HFD showed a remarkable reduction of macrophage accumulation and expression of proinflammatory genes, including MCP-1 in eWAT. Moreover, adipocyte hypertrophy, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and hepatic fatty change were improved in PSGL-1⁻(/) ⁻mice compared with WT mice fed HFD.",

ERAP2 polymorphisms were genotyped using a TaqMan probe, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of class-I HLAB locus was performed by single specific primers-polymerase chain reaction method. To verify whether ERAP2 genotype influences susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in vitro we performed HIV-1 infection assay. We evaluated antigen presentation pathway with PCR array and the viral antigen p24 with ELISA. Genotype analysis in 104 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals (HESNs) exposed to HIV through IDU-HESN and 130 controls from Spain indicated that hapA protects from HIV infection. Meta-analysis with an Italian cohort of sexually exposed HESN yielded a P value of 7.6 × 10. HLAB typing indicated that the HLA-B*57 allele is significantly more common than expected among HESN homozygous for haplotype A (homoA). Data obtained in a cohort of 139 healthy Italian controls showed that following in-vitro HIV-1 infection the expression of ERAP2-FL and a number of genes involved in antigen presentation as well as of MHC class I on the surface of CD45 cells was significantly increased in homoA cells; notably, homoA peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but not isolated CD4 cells, were less susceptible to HIV-1 infection.",

    "context": "Monocytes and macrophages produce interleukin (IL)-10, an immunoregulatory cytokine and a potent therapeutic tool for immune disorders. Augmentation of IL-10 production with a concomitant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages in vitro is attained by doubly stimulating the cells with a toll-like receptor ligand and immunoglobulin (Ig)G immune complexes, a response known as that of regulatory (or alternatively activated/M2) macrophages. However, it has not been explored sufficiently how such a regulatory response could be exploited for anti-inflammation. Our objective is to find a potential way or condition for augmenting IL-10 by monocytes/macrophages in vivo and in vitro. We show that platelets, when they are opsonized with IgG, can convert human peripheral blood circulating monocytes to IL-10-producing regulatory monocytes in vitro and also in a murine in vivo model. Co-culturing of platelets and monocytes in the presence of anti-integrin IgG and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide augmented IL-10 production via a direct interaction between platelets and monocytes. This novel way of enhancing IL-10 was mediated by activating-type Fc receptors for IgG.",

The expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in lung tissues was determined by Western blot analysis. Administration of UTI reduced the lung wet/dry weight ratio and ameliorated the tissue damage. In the LPS/UTI treatment group, levels of TNF-α were significantly lower than those in the LPS treatment group, while the levels of IL-10 were significantly higher than those in the LPS treatment group.

We found that carnosol significantly inhibited the viability and colony growth induced G2 arrest in the triple negative MDA-MB-231. Blockade of the cell cycle was associated with increased p21/WAF1 expression and downregulation of p27. Interestingly, carnosol was found to induce beclin1-independent autophagy and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. The coexistence of both events, autophagy and apoptosis, was confirmed by electron micrography. Induction of autophagy was found to be an early event, detected within 3 h post-treatment, which subsequently led to apoptosis. Carnosol treatment also caused a dose-dependent increase in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (pERK1/2). Moreover, we show that carnosol induced DNA damage, reduced the mitochondrial potential and triggered the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, we found that carnosol induced a dose-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS by tiron, a ROS scavenger, blocked the induction of autophagy and apoptosis and attenuated DNA damage.

At St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, 66 patients were treated with EBL or endoclips from January 2004 to October 2010. Early rebleeding was defined as clinical evidence of recurrent bleeding within 30 days after initial treatment. Patients' demographics, rate of early rebleeding, and complications were retrospectively evaluated. Of the 66 patients, 18 were treated with EBL. The initial success rate for hemostasis with EBL was 100% with no complications. Early rebleeding was observed in one patient (6%), for whom eversion of a bleeding diverticulum in the sigmoid colon could not be obtained and early loss of the O-band occurred. However, the patient could be retreated with EBL. On the other hand, complete eversion could be obtained for all 10 patients with right-sided diverticula, and no early rebleeding occurred.

    "context": "Topiramate (TPM) is a novel drug with broad antiepileptic effect in children and adults. In vitro studies suggest activity as sodium-channel blocker, as gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)-receptor agonist and as non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-glutamate receptor antagonist. With transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we evaluated which of the mechanisms of action of TPM detected in vitro are relevant for the modulation of human motor cortex excitability. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design, we investigated the effect of single oral doses of 50 mg and 200 mg TPM on motor thresholds, cortical silent period (CSP), and on intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in 20 healthy subjects. A significant dose-dependent increase of ICI was noticed after 200 mg TPM as compared with placebo at short interstimulus intervals of 2 to 4 ms. TPM had no effect on motor thresholds or the CSP.",
    "response": "We conclude that a single dose of TPM selectively increases ICI by GABAAergic and/or glutamatergic mechanisms without a relevant influence on measures, depending on ion-channel blockade or GABAB-receptor activity. The decrease of intracortical excitability (as measured by ICI and ICF) caused by TPM may correlate with its lack of proconvulsive potential in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, because drugs without this action or with less pronounced action may exacerbate seizures in this condition.",

    "context": "Vasopressor-induced hypertension is routinely indicated for prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Mechanisms underlying patients' clinical improvement during vasopressor-induced hypertension remain incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate angiographic effects of normovolaemic Norepinephrine (NE)-induced hypertension therapy on the rabbit basilar artery (BA) after SAH. Cerebral vasospasm was induced using the one-haemorrhage rabbit model; sham-operated animals served as controls. Five days later the animals underwent follow-up angiography prior to and during NE-induced hypertension. Changes in diameter of the BA were digitally calculated in mean microm +/- SEM (standard error of mean). Significant CVS of 14.2% was documented in the BA of the SAH animals on day 5 compared to the baseline angiogram on day 0 (n = 12, p < 0.01), whereas the BA of the control animals remained statistically unchanged (n = 12, p > 0.05). During systemic administration of NE, mean arterial pressure increased from 70.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg to 136.0 +/- 2.1 mmHg in the SAH group (n = 12, p < 0.001) and from 72.0 +/- 3.1 to 137.8 +/- 1.3 in the control group (n = 12, p < 0.001). On day 5 after SAH, a significant dilatation of the BA in response to norepinephrine could be demonstrated in both groups. The diameter of the BA in the SAH group increased from 640.5 +/- 17.5 microm to 722.5 +/- 23.7 microm (n = 12, p < 0.05; ). In the control group the diameter increased from 716.8 +/- 15.5 microm to 779.9 +/- 24.1 microm (n = 12, p < 0.05).",

Anatomic and functional outcomes, as well as ocular complications, were noted. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), vitreous haze score, and presence of increased intraocular pressure or cataract. Average follow-up was 17.3 ± 1.8 months after the first implant (median, 13.3 months; range, 3-54.5 months; 54.65 eye-years), with 14 eyes (36.9%) receiving a single implant and 24 eyes (63.1%) receiving multiple implantations. After the first implantation, average BCVA improved significantly from 0.47 ± 0.05 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units (Snellen equivalent, 20/60) to 0.27 ± 0.07 logMAR (Snellen equivalent, 20/37; P<0.001); CRT decreased by 263 ± 44.22 μm (P = 0.003), although macular edema persisted in 50% of eyes, and the percentage of eyes achieving a vitreous haze score of 0 increased from 58% to 83% (P = 0.03).

To our knowledge, no biomechanical studies have compared the effect of enhancement with biomaterial on two different volar fixed-angle plates. Human fresh-frozen cadaver pairs of radii were used to simulate an AO/OTA 23-A3 fracture. In a total of four groups (n = 7 for each group), two volar fixed-angle plates (Aptus 2.5 mm locking fracture plate, Medartis, Switzerland and VA-LCP two-column distal radius plate 2.4, volar, Synthes, Switzerland) with or without an additional injection of a biomaterial (Hydroset Injectable HA Bone Substitute, Stryker, Switzerland) into the dorsal comminution zone were used to fix the distal metaphyseal fragment. Each specimen was tested load-controlled under cyclic loading with a servo-hydraulic material testing machine. Displacement, stiffness, dissipated work and failure mode were recorded. Improved mechanical properties (decreased displacement, increased stiffness, decreased dissipated work) were found in both plates if the biomaterial was additionally injected. Improvement of mechanical parameters after biomaterial injection was more evident in the Synthes plate compared to the Aptus plate. Pushing out of the screws was noticed as a failure mode only in samples lacking supplementary biomaterial.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diffusion coefficient D(av) and fractional anisotropy (FA) are able to detect quantifiable differences among three groups of focal nonactive multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions that appear qualitatively different on T1-weighted images. Conventional and diffusion tensor MR images of the brain were obtained in 18 patients with relapsing remitting (n = 10) or secondary progressive (n=8) MS and in 18 healthy volunteers. Focal nonactive MS lesions were classified as T1 isointense, T1 mildly hypointense, and T1 severely hypointense on unenhanced T1-weighted images. Differences among groups were assessed with one-way analysis of variance using the T1 lesion appearance as the grouping factor and either FA or coefficient D(av) as the dependent measure. FA was lowest and coefficient D(av) was highest in T1 severely hypointense lesions, and then, in ascending and descending order, respectively, T1 mildly hypointense lesions and T1 isointense lesions. A significant difference in the values of FA was detected only between T1 isointense lesions and T1 severely hypointense lesions (P <.01), whereas no difference was found between T1 mildly hypointense lesions and either one of these two groups.

Cyclin D1 is frequently deregulated in various cancers, including malignant hemopathies, and tumor cells display uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 is not expressed in the B-cell lineage but is found in multiple myeloma (MM) cells in almost 50% of patients with this condition. Paradoxically, cyclin D1 expression is associated with a good prognosis and longer overall survival in MM patients. We used two independent MM cell lines (RPMI 8226 and LP1) to generate several clones stably expressing either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a GFP-cyclin D1 fusion protein, and we analyzed the properties acquired following cyclin D1 expression. Whole-genome expression analysis in the cell clones indicated that cyclin D1 profoundly modified several cellular functions, including the regulation of apoptotic cell death. We studied the apoptotic response of GFP- and GFP-cyclin D1-expressing clones to bortezomib-treatment. We found that the apoptotic response occurred faster and was of a greater amplitude in cyclin D1-expressing cells. Cyclin D1 expression enhanced the caspase-dependent apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. More importantly, cyclin D1 also activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis.",

We measured the distribution of myosin heavy chain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb by SDS gel electrophoresis. We also measured the activities of the following enzymes: citrate synthase, a marker of oxidative metabolism; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a marker of lipolytic metabolism; and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of glycolytic metabolism. In normal subjects, the distribution of myosin heavy chain isoforms I, IIa, and IIb was 43 +/- 2%, 40 +/- 2%, and 17 +/- 1%, respectively. In contrast, in heart failure subjects, the fiber distribution was 55 +/- 2%, 38 +/- 2%, and 7 +/- 2% for types I, IIa, and IIb, respectively. Therefore, in heart failure, myosin heavy chain I is increased (P < .0001) and myosin heavy chain IIb decreased from normal levels (P < .001).

This study aimed to explore potential molecular pathways underlying HG functional mechanism during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, involving lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13. Murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured in osteogenic-inducing medium supplemented with high glucose level at 25mM or 5.5mM as normal control. Expression levels of lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13 were measured by using real-time PCR. The mineralized nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were detected after 21 and 7days of incubation respectively. Western blot were also performed to determine the expression of CXCL13 and osteogenic gene markers.

    "instruction": "Is interstitial Fluid Glucose Just a Shifted-in-Time but a Distorted Mirror of Blood Glucose : Insight from an In Silico Study?",
    "context": "Glucose sensors measure glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid (ISF), remote from blood. ISF glucose is well known to be \"delayed\" with respect to blood glucose (BG). However, ISF glucose is not simply a shifted-in-time version of BG but exhibits a more complex pattern. To gain insight into this problem, one can use linear systems theory. However, this may lose a more clinical readership, thus we use simulation and two case studies to convey our thinking in an easier way. In particular, we consider BG concentration measured after meal and exercise in 12 healthy volunteers, whereas ISF glucose is simulated using a well-accepted model of blood-ISF glucose kinetics, which permits calculation of the equilibration time, a parameter characterizing the system. Two metrics are defined: blood and ISF glucose difference at each time point and time to reach the same glucose value in blood and ISF. The simulation performed and the two metrics show that the relationship between blood-ISF glucose profiles is more complex than a pure shift in time and that the pattern depends on both equilibration time and BG.",
    "response": "In this in silico study, we have illustrated, with simple case studies, the meaning of the of ISF glucose with respect to BG. Understanding that ISF glucose is not just a shifted-in-time version but a distorted mirror of BG is important for a correct use of continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes management.",

    "context": "The family food environment is an important influence in the development of children's dietary habits. Research suggests that influences of current dietary behaviour and behaviour change may differ. The aims of this paper were to: (1) investigate the association between the food environment at baseline and change in children's saturated fat intake; and (2) to explore whether a change in the food environment was associated with a change in children's saturated fat intake. Secondary analysis of a 12 week cluster randomised controlled trial in 133 4-13 year old children. Families were randomly allocated to parental education regarding changing to reduced-fat dairy foods or a comparison non-dietary behaviour. The interventions were family focused. Parents received education from a dietitian in 3x30 minute sessions to facilitate behaviour change. Parents completed a comprehensive questionnaire capturing three domains of the food environment--Parent knowledge and attitudes; shaping practices; and behaviours and role modelling. Children's dietary intake was assessed via multiple 24-hour recalls at baseline and week 12. Changes in the family food environment and primary outcome (saturated fat) were calculated. Hierarchical linear regression models were performed to explore the association between baseline and change in food environment constructs and change in saturated fat intake. Standardised Beta are presented (p<0.05). After adjustments for child and family demographics, higher levels of perceived food availability (β=-0.2) at baseline was associated with greater reduction in saturated fat intake, where as higher perceived responsibility (β=0.2), restriction (β=0.3) and pressure to eat (β=0.3) were associated with lesser change in saturated fat. An increase in nutrition knowledge (β=-0.2), perceived responsibility (β=-0.3) and restriction (β=-0.3) from baseline to week 12 were associated with greater reduction in saturated fat intake.",
    "response": "The present study was one of the first to quantify changes in the family food environment, and identify a number of factors which were associated with a positive dietary change.

The effects of Axl knockdown in RCC cells on cell growth and signalling were investigated. The efficacy of a humanised Axl targeting monoclonal antibody hMAb173 was tested in histoculture and tumour xenograft. We have determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) that Axl is expressed in 59% of RCC array samples with moderate to high in 20% but not expressed in normal kidney tissue. Western blot analysis of 11 pairs of tumour and adjacent normal tissue show high Axl expression in 73% of the tumours but not normal tissue. Axl is also expressed in RCC cell lines in which Axl knockdown reduces cell viability and PI3K/Akt signalling. The Axl antibody hMAb173 significantly induced RCC cell apoptosis in histoculture and inhibited the growth of RCC tumour in vivo by 78%.

Fifty-one consecutive healthy postmenopausal women (age 48 +/- 5) with negative exercise stress testing were prospectively enrolled into the study. Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained to evaluate the effects of 6 months of HRT on QT intervals, corrected QT intervals (QTcmax and QTcmin), QT dispersion (QTd), and corrected QTd (QTcd). Hormone regimens were continuous 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or 0.625 mg/day CEE alone depending on the hysterectomy status. Although not statistically significant, CEE alone or in combination with MPA increased QTmax and QTmin values. However, the increase in QTmin was greater than the increase in QTmax, which resulted in statistically significant shortening of QTd (P = 0.007 in CEE and P < 0.001 in CEE + MPA groups). There was a significant prolongation of QTcmin values after 6 months in patients assigned to the CEE group (P = 0.001).

    "instruction": "Does mechanosensory organ regeneration in zebrafish depend on a population of multipotent progenitor cells kept latent by Schwann cells?",
    "context": "Regenerating damaged tissue is a complex process, requiring progenitor cells that must be stimulated to undergo proliferation, differentiation and, often, migratory behaviors and morphological changes. Multiple cell types, both resident within the damaged tissue and recruited to the lesion site, have been shown to participate. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation after injury, and their regulation by different cells types, are not fully understood. The zebrafish lateral line is a suitable system to study regeneration because most of its components are fully restored after damage. The posterior lateral line (PLL) is a mechanosensory system that develops embryonically and is initially composed of seven to eight neuromasts distributed along the trunk and tail, connected by a continuous stripe of interneuromastic cells (INCs). The INCs remain in a quiescent state owing to the presence of underlying Schwann cells. They become activated during development to form intercalary neuromasts. However, no studies have described if INCs can participate in a regenerative event, for example, after the total loss of a neuromast. We used electroablation in transgenic larvae expressing fluorescent proteins in PLL components to completely ablate single neuromasts in larvae and adult fish. This injury results in discontinuity of the INCs, Schwann cells, and the PLL nerve. In vivo imaging showed that the INCs fill the gap left after the injury and can regenerate a new neuromast in the injury zone. Further, a single INC is able to divide and form all cell types in a regenerated neuromast and, during this process, it transiently expresses the sox2 gene, a neural progenitor cell marker. We demonstrate a critical role for Schwann cells as negative regulators of INC proliferation and neuromast regeneration, and that this inhibitory property is completely dependent on active ErbB signaling.",
    "response": "The potential to regenerate a neuromast after damage requires that progenitor cells (INCs) be temporarily released from an inhibitory signal produced by nearby Schwann cells.

Inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL1), are thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced bone loss, but their exact roles are yet to be determined. To determine whether TNF directly triggers bone loss or requires IL1, human TNFalpha mice (hTNFtg) were crossed with mice lacking IL1alpha and IL1beta (IL1(-/-)hTNFtg). Systemic bone architecture was evaluated using CT scanning, static and dynamic bone histomorphometry and serum markers of bone metabolism. hTNFtg mice developed severe bone loss accompanied by a severe distortion of bone microarchitecture. Bone trabeculae were thinner and decreased in numbers, resulting in increased trabecular separation. Histomorphometric analyses revealed strongly increased bone resorption in hTNFtg mice compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, IL1(-/-)hTNFtg mice were fully protected from systemic bone loss despite still developing inflammation in their joints.

The aim of this study was to gain further insight into endocervical lesions with a gastric phenotype. Various types of tunnel clusters (TC) were examined for gastric mucin by alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff staining and immunohistochemistry for HIK1083. Five of 34 cases of TC expressed gastric mucin defined by PAS dominant neutral mucin and immunopositivity for pyloric gland mucin. Histologically, TC expressing gastric mucin showed lobular arrangements of small to medium-sized glands composed of mucin-rich columnar cells and were classified as Flumann's type A TC. Neither type B TC nor normal endocervical glands expressed PAS dominant neutral mucin and none of them was immunopositive for pyloric gland mucin. Five patients with type A TC of gastric phenotype ranged in age from 33 to 79 years (mean 58 years) and were multiparous. Type A TC of gastric phenotype, ranging from 2 to 4 mm in maximum diameter, were incidental findings in hysterectomy specimens.",

    "context": "In order to assess the frequency of aneuploidy and mosaicism in embryos obtained from IVF patients aged <38 years, preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) was performed after biopsy of two blastomeres. Furthermore, the reliability of this diagnosis was assessed by performing reanalysis of the embryo on day 5. The copy numbers of 10 chromosomes (1, 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y) were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Embryos that were found to be abnormal or of insufficient morphological quality were cultured until day 5 and reanalysed. Results obtained were compared to the day 3 blastomere analysis. After analysis of 196 embryos (one cell in 38% and two cells in 62%), only 36% of the embryos were found to be normal on day 3. After analysis of two blastomeres, 50% showed chromosomal mosaicism. Comparison of the FISH results from day 3 blastomeres and day 5 embryos yielded an overall cytogenetic confirmation rate of 54%.",
    "response": "The rates of mosaicism and aneuploidy in these embryos from young IVF patients are similar to those published for older women. We found the best confirmation rate after a diagnosis based on two cells, where both blastomeres showed the same chromosomal abnormality. In contrast, after a mosaic diagnosis the confirmation rate was low. The present study provides the first detailed reanalysis data of embryos analysed by PGS and clearly demonstrates the impact of mosaicism on the reliability of the PGS diagnosis.",

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a multi-institutional effort to reduce blood product use affects postoperative events after cardiac surgical operations and to determine the influence of perioperative transfusion on risk-adjusted outcomes. A total of 14,259 patients (2006-2010) undergoing nonemergency, primary, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting operations at 17 different statewide cardiac centers were stratified according to transfusion guideline era: pre-guideline (n = 7059, age = 63.7 ± 10.6 years) versus post-guideline (n = 7200, age = 63.7 ± 10.5 years). Primary outcomes of interest were observed differences in postoperative events and mortality risk-adjusted associations as estimated by multiple regression analysis. Overall intraoperative (24% vs 18%, P < .001) and postoperative (39% vs 33%, P < .001) blood product transfusion were significantly reduced in the post-guideline era. Patients in the post-guideline era demonstrated reduced morbidity with decreased pneumonia (P = .01), prolonged ventilation (P = .05), renal failure (P = .03), new-onset hemodialysis (P = .004), and composite incidence of major complications (P = .001). Operative mortality (1.0% vs 1.8%, P < .001) and postoperative ventilation time (22 vs 26 hours, P < .001) were similarly reduced in the post-guideline era. Of note, after mortality risk adjustment, operations performed in the post-guideline era were associated with a 47% reduction in the odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; P < .001), whereas the risk of major complications and mortality were significantly increased after intraoperative (adjusted odds ratio, 1.86 and 1.25; both P < .001) and postoperative (adjusted odds ratio, 4.61 and 4.50, both P < .001) transfusion.

    "context": "Over the last few years, a role for the brain catalase-H(2)O(2) enzymatic system has been suggested in the behavioural effects observed in rodents after ethanol administration. This role seems to be related to the ability of cerebral catalase to metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde using H(2)O(2)as a co-substrate. On the other hand, it has been shown that normobaric hyperoxia increases the rate of cerebral H(2)O(2) production in rodents in vivo. Thus, substrate-level changes could regulate brain catalase activity, thereby modulating the behavioural effects of ethanol. The aim of the present study was to assess if the enhancement of cerebral H(2)O(2) production after hyperoxia exposure results in a boost of ethanol-induced locomotion in mice. CD-1 mice were exposed to air or 99.5% O(2) inhalation (for 15, 30, or 45 min) and 0, 30, 60 or 120 min after this treatment, ethanol-induced locomotion was measured. The H(2)O(2)-mediated inactivation of endogenous brain catalase activity following an injection of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was used as a measure of the rate of cerebral H(2)O(2) production. Hyperoxia exposure (30 or 45 min) potentiated the locomotor-stimulating effects of ethanol (2.5 or 3.0 g/kg), whereas cocaine (4 mg/kg) or caffeine (15 mg/kg)-induced locomotion and blood ethanol levels were unaffected. Moreover, the results also confirmed brain H(2)O(2) overproduction in mice.",

A virus dose-dependent reduction in chemokinesis and VEGF-dependent chemotaxis was observed (P < 0.05). UV-inactivated virus did not inhibit chemotaxis or chemokinesis, indicating that viral gene expression is mandatory.

This protein down-modulation could not be inhibited by Ganciclovir. The remaining VEGFR-2 expressed on infected HCAEC was able to stimulate cell activation. Second, HCMV infection influences actin polymerization in HCAEC as shown by FACS analysis: actin polymerization was significantly reduced to 53 and 51% (P < 0.05) compared with non-infected HCAEC at 24 and 72 h p.i., respectively.

Phopholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in progression of colorectal carcinoma However, an understanding of the targets and regulation of this important pathway remains incomplete and besides, relationship between Wnt signaling and PLD is not known. Here, we demonstrate that PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2 are direct targets and positive feedback regulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Wnt3a and Wnt mimetics significantly enhanced the expression of PLDs at a transcriptional level in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, whereas silencing of beta-catenin gene expression or utilization of a dominant negative form of T cell factor-4 (TCF-4) inhibited expression of PLDs. Moreover, both PLD1 and PLD2 were highly induced in colon, liver and stomach tissues of mice after injection of LiCl, a Wnt mimetic. Wnt3a stimulated formation of the beta-catenin/TCF complexes to two functional TCF-4-binding elements within the PLD2 promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppressing PLD using gene silencing or selective inhibitor blocked the ability of beta-catenin to transcriptionally activate PLD and other Wnt target genes by preventing formation of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex, whereas tactics to elevate intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity, enhanced these effects.

Cell cycle was sequentially monitored by live-cell imaging for up to 5 days after exposure to 10 Gy of X-rays. Live-cell imaging revealed that cell cycle transition from G2 to G1 phase without mitosis, so-called mitotic skipping, was observed in 17.1% and 69.8% of G1- and G2-irradiated cells, respectively. Entry to G1 phase was confirmed by the nuclear accumulation of mKO(2)-hCdt1 as well as cyclin E, which was inversely correlated to the accumulation of G2-specific markers such as mAG-hGeminin and CENP-F. More than 90% of cells skipping mitosis were persistently arrested in G1 phase and showed positive staining for the senescent biochemical marker, which is senescence-associated ß-galactosidase, indicating induction of senescence-like growth arrest accompanied by mitotic skipping. While G2 irradiation with higher doses of X-rays induced mitotic skipping in approximately 80% of cells, transduction of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for p53 significantly suppressed mitotic skipping, suggesting that ionizing radiation-induced mitotic skipping is associated with p53 function.",

    "context": "Moderate exercise regimens have shown minor positive effects on matrix turnover in articular cartilage (AC), while effects at cellular level, e.g. proliferation, are scarcely described. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate exercise on cell proliferation and recruitment of cells possibly active in regeneration in different regions of cartilage in the rat knee joint. Eighteen rats were orally given 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 14 days for in vivo DNA labeling. Nine rats underwent treadmill training for 50 min/day, 5 days/week (exercise group), and 9 rats served as controls (no exercise). Animals were sacrificed after 14, 56 and 105 days, and knee joints were harvested. BrdU+ cells were visualized immunohistochemically (IHC) and counted in AC, posterior stem cell niche (PN), potential migration route (PMR; area between PN and the AC border), potential migration area (PMA; region between PN and AC including PN) and epiphyseal cartilage plate (EP) of the tibia and femur. Compared to controls, in the exercise group BrdU+ cells/mm(2) were increased on days 14 (p = 0.022) and 105 (p = 0.045) in AC of the tibia and on day 105 (p = 0.014) in AC of the femur. BrdU+ cell numbers were increased in the PMR region of the tibia on days 14 (p = 0.023) and 105 (p = 0.0018) and in the PMR region of the femur on day 105 (p = 0.0099) as well as in the PMA region of the tibia (p = 0.0008) and femur (p = 0.0080) on day 105.

    "context": "Vitamin D is an important immune modulator that plays an emerging role in inflammatory and metabolic liver diseases, including infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In contrast, the relationship between vitamin D metabolism and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is less well characterized. Therefore, we quantified 25(OH)D3 serum levels in a cohort of 203 treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and tested for their association with clinical parameters of CHB. Of 203 patients, 69 (34%), 95 (47%), and 39 (19%) had severe vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D3 <10 ng/mL), vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D3 ≥10 and <20 ng/mL), or adequate vitamin D serum levels (25(OH)D3 ≥20 ng/mL), respectively. In both uni- and multivariate analyses, HBV DNA viral load (log10 IU/mL) was a strong predictor of low 25(OH)D3 serum levels (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.000048, respectively) and vice versa. Mean 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations in patients with HBV DNA <2,000 versus ≥2,000 IU/mL were 17 versus 11 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.00001). In addition, hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients had lower 25(OH)D3 serum levels than HBeAg-negative patients (P = 0.0013). Finally, 25(OH)D3 and HBV DNA serum levels showed inverse seasonal fluctuations.",
    "response": "Low 25(OH)D3 serum levels are associated with high levels of HBV replication in patients with CHB. This represents a major difference from chronic hepatitis C, where numerous previous studies have shown a lack of correlation between HCV viral load and vitamin D serum levels.

In rodents, several FGFs are expressed in the pancreas, where they participate in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Our objective was to describe the pattern of expression of FGFs in the human embryonic pancreas and to analyse their effect on pancreas development. The expression of FGFs was analysed by RT-PCR. To investigate the cell types expressing FGF7 and FGF10, we separated epithelial from mesenchymal cells using immunomagnetic beads linked to E-cadherin antibodies and performed real-time PCR. The effect of FGF7 and FGF10 on proliferation of human embryonic pancreatic epithelial cells was evaluated in vitro by measuring BrdU incorporation. We found that different FGFs are expressed in the human embryonic pancreas, and we focused on FGF7 and FGF10. We defined a new approach to separating epithelial cells (containing the pancreatic progenitor cells) from mesenchymal cells. This allowed us to demonstrate that human embryonic pancreatic mesenchymal cells express both FGF7 and FGF10. We next demonstrated that FGF7 and FGF10 were able to induce the proliferation of the epithelial cells in vitro.",

    "context": "The type I interferon (IFN) response is a critical component of the innate immune response to infection by RNA viruses and is initiated via recognition of viral nucleic acids by RIG-like receptors (RLR). Engagement of these receptors in the cytoplasm initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, ATF-2 and IRF-3 that coordinately upregulate transcription of type I IFN genes, such as that encoding IFN-β. In this study the impact of poliovirus infection on the type I interferon response has been examined. The type I IFN response was assessed by measuring IFN-β mRNA levels using qRT-PCR and normalizing to levels of β-actin mRNA. The status of host factors involved in activation of the type I IFN response was examined by immunoblot, immunofluorescence microcopy and qRT-PCR. The results show that poliovirus infection results in induction of very low levels of IFN-β mRNA despite clear activation of NF-κB and ATF-2. In contrast, analysis of IRF-3 revealed no transcriptional induction of an IRF-3-responsive promoter or homodimerization of IRF-3 indicating it is not activated in poliovirus-infected cells. Exposure of poliovirus-infected cells to poly(I:C) results in lower levels of IFN-β mRNA synthesis and IRF-3 activation compared to mock-infected cells. Analysis of MDA-5 and IPS-1 revealed that these components of the RLR pathway were largely intact at times when the type I IFN response was suppressed.",

    "context": "Cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) are generated in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and migrate tangentially into cortex. Because most, if not all, migrating MGE-derived INs express the neuregulin (NRG) receptor, ErbB4, we investigated influences of Nrg1 isoforms and Nrg3 on IN migration through ventral telencephalon (vTel) and within cortex. During IN migration, NRG expression domains and distributions of ErbB4-expressing, MGE-derived INs are complementary with minimal overlap, both in vTel and cortex. In wild-type mice, within fields of NRG expression, these INs are focused at positions of low or absent NRG expression. However, in ErbB4-/- HER4(heart) mutant mice in which INs lack ErbB4, these complementary patterns are degraded with considerable overlap evident between IN distribution and NRG expression domains. These findings suggest that NRGs are repellents for migrating ErbB4-expressing INs, a function supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, in collagen co-cultures, MGE-derived cells preferentially migrate away from a source of secreted NRGs. Second, cells migrating from wild-type MGE explants on living forebrain slices from wild-type embryonic mice tend to avoid endogenous NRG expression domains, whereas this avoidance behavior is not exhibited by ErbB4-deficient cells migrating from MGE explants and instead they have a radial pattern with a more uniform distribution. Third, ectopic NRG expression in the IN migration pathway produced by in utero electroporation blocks IN migration and results in cortex distal to the blockade being largely devoid of INs. Finally, fewer INs reach cortex in ErbB4 mutants, indicating that NRG-ErbB4 signaling is required for directing IN migration from the MGE to cortex.",
    "response": "Our results show that NRGs act as repellents for migrating ErbB4-expressing, MGE-derived GABAergic INs and that the patterned expression of NRGs funnels INs as they migrate from the MGE to their cortical destinations.",

We searched the literature and retrospectively reviewed all records of patients referred with haemoptysis between 2000 and 2010 at the Department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. A total of 379 patient records were reviewed for inclusion in the clinical part of the study. Of these, 269 had the information required for the study and had been examined with CT. In all, 16 of the 269 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. In all of these, a tumour or other findings indicating a possible tumour were seen on the chest CT. No additional cases of lung cancer were discovered during FOB, and no cases had been missed by the CT.",

However, the role of nNOS in cardiac electrophysiology after myocardial infarction (MI) is unclear. We hypothesized that nNOS deficiency increases ventricular arrhythmia and mortality after MI. MI was induced in wild-type (WT) or nNOS(-/-) mice by ligation of the left coronary artery. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT mice. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) mice had impaired cardiac function 2 days after MI. Telemetric ECG monitoring showed that compared with WT, nNOS(-/-) mice had significantly more ventricular arrhythmias and were more likely to develop ventricular fibrillation after MI. Treatment with the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil reduced the incidence of arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation in nNOS(-/-) mice after MI. To assess the role of nNOS in Ca2+ handling, patch-clamp and Ca2+ fluorescence techniques were used. Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ currents were higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT cardiomyocytes. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic Ca2+ over a range of pacing frequencies.

    "context": "The three layer mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade exhibits different designs of interactions between its kinases and phosphatases. While the sequential interactions between the three kinases of the cascade are tightly preserved, the phosphatases of the cascade, such as MKP3 and PP2A, exhibit relatively diverse interactions with their substrate kinases. Additionally, the kinases of the MAPK cascade can also sequester their phosphatases. Thus, each topologically distinct interaction design of kinases and phosphatases could exhibit unique signal processing characteristics, and the presence of phosphatase sequestration may lead to further fine tuning of the propagated signal. We have built four architecturally distinct types of models of the MAPK cascade, each model with identical kinase-kinase interactions but unique kinases-phosphatases interactions. Our simulations unravelled that MAPK cascade's robustness to external perturbations is a function of nature of interaction between its kinases and phosphatases. The cascade's output robustness was enhanced when phosphatases were sequestrated by their target kinases. We uncovered a novel implicit/hidden negative feedback loop from the phosphatase MKP3 to its upstream kinase Raf-1, in a cascade resembling the B cell MAPK cascade. Notably, strength of the feedback loop was reciprocal to the strength of phosphatases' sequestration and stronger sequestration abolished the feedback loop completely. An experimental method to verify the presence of the feedback loop is also proposed. We further showed, when the models were activated by transient signal, memory (total time taken by the cascade output to reach its unstimulated level after removal of signal) of a cascade was determined by the specific designs of interaction among its kinases and phosphatases.",
    "response": "Differences in interaction designs among the kinases and phosphatases can differentially shape the robustness and signal response behaviour of the MAPK cascade and phosphatase sequestration dramatically enhances the robustness to perturbations in each of the cascade.

Increased passive resistance in the triceps surae muscles is common following acquired brain injury. Adaptive shortening secondary to relative immobility, and increased stiffness due to rheologic changes within the musculo-tendinous unit, may be exacerbated by plantarflexor muscle overactivity related to the brain injury itself. Three variables representing resistance to passive lengthening and soleus muscle length were compared between subjects with recent brain injury and age matched normal controls. Comparison between limbs was made for subjects with unilateral neurological impairment. Slow passive dorsiflexion stretches were performed using a computer controlled dynamometer. Muscle stiffness in the initial and latter portion of the range, and the angles achieved at torques of 5 and 10 N m were determined from torque-angle curves. Maximal ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed was considered to reflect soleus muscle length. Significant differences were demonstrated for all variables, except passive stiffness near the end of available range.

Different CaMKII isoforms exist. Specifically targeting CaMKIIδ, the dominant isoform in the heart, could be of therapeutic potential without impairing other CaMKII isoforms. We investigated whether cardiomyocyte function is affected by isoform-specific knockout (KO) of CaMKIIδ under basal conditions and upon stress, i.e. upon ß-adrenergic stimulation and during acidosis. Systolic cardiac function was largely preserved in the KO in vivo (echocardiography) corresponding to unchanged Ca(2+)-transient amplitudes and isolated myocyte contractility in vitro. CaMKII activity was dramatically reduced while phosphatase-1 inhibitor-1 was significantly increased. Surprisingly, while diastolic Ca(2+)-elimination was slower in KO most likely due to decreased phospholamban Thr-17 phosphorylation, frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation was still present. Despite decreased SR Ca(2+)-reuptake at lower frequencies, SR Ca(2+)-content was not diminished, which might be due to reduced diastolic SR Ca(2+)-loss in the KO as a consequence of lower RyR Ser-2815 phosphorylation. Challenging KO myocytes with isoproterenol showed intact inotropic and lusitropic responses. During acidosis, SR Ca(2+)-reuptake and SR Ca(2+)-loading were significantly impaired in KO, resulting in an inability to maintain systolic Ca(2+)-transients during acidosis and impaired recovery.",

Pure-tone thresholds (250 to 8000 Hz) were measured twice in test (n = 18) and control (n = 10) groups. TM electrodes were placed between first and second threshold measurements in the test group, whereas the control group did not receive electrodes. Pure-tone threshold shifts were compared between groups. The effect of TM electrode contact location on threshold shifts was evaluated in the test group. TM electrodes significantly increased average low-frequency thresholds, 7.5 dB at 250 Hz and 4.2 dB at 500 Hz, and shifts were as large as 25 dB in individual ears. Also, threshold shifts did not appear to vary at any frequency with TM electrode contact location.",

    "context": "Free nitric oxide (NO) reacts with sulphydryl residues to form S-nitrosothiols, which act as NO reservoirs. We sought to determine whether thiol-preserving agents and antioxidants, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and vitamin C, induce NO release from S-nitrosylated proteins in endothelial cell cultures to promote angiogenesis. NO release was measured directly in cell supernatants using a Sievers NO Analyser, and in vitro angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying capillary-like tube network formation of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) on growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Incubation of PAEC with DTT or vitamin C significantly increased NO release in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, L-NNA and L-NIO, had no effect on DTT- or vitamin C-induced NO release, and there was no concomitant increase in the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS at serine-1177 following DTT or vitamin C treatment. DTT and vitamin C increased capillary-like tube network formation by nine- and two-fold, respectively, and the addition of copper ions doubled the effect of vitamin C. Surprisingly, DTT maintained endothelial tube networks for up to one month under serum-free conditions, and selective inhibitors of guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) and PKG (KT-5823) blocked this, demonstrating the requirement of cyclic GMP and PKG in this process.",

To determine if the magnitude of frontal plane knee angle, as determined with a 3-D motion-capture system (knee abduction angle [KAA]) or digital video (frontal plane projection angle [FPPA]), varies among groups of individuals with different frontal plane knee position, as determined by observational ratings. Performing functional tasks with the knee positioned medial to the foot may increase the risk for knee injury. The KAA and FPPA are commonly used in research settings to determine injury risk. However, observational ratings of frontal plane knee position are easier to perform in the clinical setting. It is not clear whether observational ratings of knee position can be used as a surrogate for the KAA or FPPA. Eighty-one female collegiate athletes performed a lateral step-down task. Participants were rated as good, fair, or poor based on observation of their knee position relative to the foot in the frontal plane and assigned to observational rating groups. Movement was concurrently recorded with a 3-D motion-capture system and a digital video camera to calculate KAA and FPPA, respectively.

We evaluated the expression changes of miRNAs in the rat heart after PIO administration using miRNA arrays and then confirmed the result by northern blot. miR-29a and c levels decreased remarkably after 7-day treatment with PIO. In H9c2 cells, the effects of PIO and rosiglitazone on miR-29 expression levels were blocked by a selective PPAR-gamma inhibitor GW9662. Downregulation of miR-29 by antisense inhibitor or by PIO protected H9c2 cells from simulated IR injury, indicated as increased cell survival and decreased caspase-3 activity. In contrast, overexpressing miR-29 promoted apoptosis and completely blocked the protective effect of PIO.

Using two models of biliary injury where repair occurs through cholangiocyte proliferation and hepatocyte transdifferentiation to cholangiocytes, we identify an important role of Wnt signaling. First we identify up-regulation of specific Wnt proteins in the cholangiocytes. Next, using conditional knockouts of Wntless and Wnt coreceptors low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5/6, transgenic mice expressing stable β-catenin, and in vitro studies, we show a role of Wnt signaling through β-catenin in hepatocyte to biliary transdifferentiation.

Respiration-correlated cone-beam CT (RC-CBCT) can improve localization accuracy in mobile lung tumors, but further increases the time and workload for conventionally fractionated treatments. This study investigates whether RC-CBCT-guided correction of systematic tumor deviations in standard fractionated lung tumor radiation treatments is more effective than 2D image-based correction of skeletal deviations alone. A second study goal compares respiration-correlated vs respiration-averaged images for determining tumor deviations. Eleven stage II-IV nonsmall cell lung cancer patients are enrolled in an IRB-approved prospective off-line protocol using RC-CBCT guidance to correct for systematic errors in GTV position. Patients receive a respiration-correlated planning CT (RCCT) at simulation, daily kilovoltage RC-CBCT scans during the first week of treatment and weekly scans thereafter. Four types of correction methods are compared: (1) systematic error in gross tumor volume (GTV) position, (2) systematic error in skeletal anatomy, (3) daily skeletal corrections, and (4) weekly skeletal corrections. The comparison is in terms of weighted average of the residual GTV deviations measured from the RC-CBCT scans and representing the estimated residual deviation over the treatment course. In the second study goal, GTV deviations computed from matching RCCT and RC-CBCT are compared to deviations computed from matching respiration-averaged images consisting of a CBCT reconstructed using all projections and an average-intensity-projection CT computed from the RCCT. Of the eleven patients in the GTV-based systematic correction protocol, two required no correction, seven required a single correction, one required two corrections, and one required three corrections. Mean residual GTV deviation (3D distance) following GTV-based systematic correction (mean ± 1 standard deviation 4.8 ± 1.5 mm) is significantly lower than for systematic skeletal-based (6.5 ± 2.9 mm, p = 0.015), and weekly skeletal-based correction (7.2 ± 3.0 mm, p = 0.001), but is not significantly lower than daily skeletal-based correction (5.4 ± 2.6 mm, p = 0.34). In two cases, first-day CBCT images reveal tumor changes-one showing tumor growth, the other showing large tumor displacement-that are not readily observed in radiographs. Differences in computed GTV deviations between respiration-correlated and respiration-averaged images are 0.2 ± 1.8 mm in the superior-inferior direction and are of similar magnitude in the other directions.",

The initiation of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (1:1) using a 40-mL intraaortic balloon inserted through the left femoral artery resulted in an increase in mean systemic blood pressure (49 +/- 2 to 61 +/- 3 mm Hg; p < 0.01), cardiac index (1.02 +/- 0.11 to 1.45 +/- 0.14; p < 0.05), RV ejection fraction (0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.23 +/- 0.02; p < 0.01), and blood flow to the left ventricle.",
    "response": "In a model of right heart failure, the institution of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation caused a significant improvement in cardiac function. Although RV ischemia was not demonstrated, the augmentation of left coronary artery blood flow by intraaortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequent improvement in left ventricular function suggest that left ventricular ischemia contributes to RV dysfunction, presumably through a ventricular interdependence mechanism. Therefore, study of the safety and efficacy of intraaortic balloon counterpulsation in the management of patients with acute right heart dysfunction is warranted.",

    "instruction": "Is the microvascular response to transdermal iontophoresis of insulin mediated by nitric oxide?",
    "context": "Insulin has direct effects on blood flow in various tissues, most likely due to endothelial NO production. We investigated whether insulin delivered to the skin by iontophoresis increases microvascular perfusion and whether this effect is partly or completely mediated by the release of NO. In healthy subjects, regular insulin and monomeric insulin were delivered to the skin by cathodal iontophoresis. The skin was pretreated either with L-NAME or control solution (PBS) using anodal iontophoresis. Microvascular responses were measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. A dose-dependent increase in perfusion was observed during iontophoresis of regular and monomeric insulin. The maximum perfusion was significantly elevated compared with control after PBS (regular insulin 53.6 (12.7-95.6) PU vs. 4.2 (3.4-4.8) PU, p = 0.002; monomeric insulin 32.6 (8.9-92.6) PU vs. 5.9 (3.4-56.0) PU, p = 0.03).

    "context": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, defined as sca-1(+)flk-1(+)lin(-) mononuclear blood cells) contribute to vascular repair. The role of hypoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mobilization and function of these cells is incompletely understood. We studied the contribution of the NADPH oxidase Nox2, an important vascular source of ROS in this context. Hypoxia (10% oxygen) induced the mobilization of EPCs in wild-type (WT) and Nox1 but not in Nox2 knockout (Nox2(y/-)) mice. As erythropoietin (EPO) is known to induce EPC mobilization, we focused on this hormone. EPO induced the mobilization of EPCs in WT and Nox1(y/-) but not Nox2(y/-) animals. Transplantation of bone marrow from Nox2(y/-) mice into WT-mice blocked mobilization in response to hypoxia and EPO, whereas transplantation of WT bone marrow into Nox2(y/-) mice restored mobilization. Reendothelialization of the injured mouse carotid artery was enhanced by hypoxia as well as by EPO, and this effect was not observed in Nox2(y/-) mice or after transplantation of Nox2(y/-) bone marrow. In cultured EPCs from WT but not Nox2(y/-) mice, EPO induced ROS production, migration, and proliferation. EPO signaling involves the STAT5 transcription factor. EPO-induced STAT5-dependent reporter gene expression was absent in Nox2-deficient cells. siRNA against the redox-sensitive phosphatase SHP-2 restored EPO-mediated STAT5 induction and inhibition of SHP-2 restored EPO-induced migration in Nox2-deficient cells",

We report on an integrative analysis from the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study using gene expression from mice to inform prioritization in a human pharmacogenetic study. The same two antidepressants were used in mice and humans: escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and nortriptyline (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). The animal study used four inbred strains of mice (129S1/SvlmJ, C57LB/6J, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ). Hippocampus mRNA levels were measured in 144 animals using the Affymetrix MOE 430 v2 chip. Based on gene-expression analysis of strain-by-drug interactions, 17 genes differentially expressed with nortriptyline or escitalopram versus saline were prioritized in the human pharmacogenetic analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging common sequence variation in human orthologs of these genes were tested for association with response to antidepressants in 706 participants of the GENDEP human pharmacogenetic study, treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline for 12 weeks, with available high-quality Illumina 610 quad array genotyping.

    "context": "Proteins of the IQGAP family have been identified as candidate effectors for the Rho family of GTPases; however, little is known about their cellular functions. The domain structures of IQGAP family members make them excellent candidates as regulators of the cytoskeleton: their sequences include an actin-binding domain homologous to that found in calponin, IQ motifs for interaction with calmodulin, and a GTPase-binding domain. The genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a single gene encoding an IQGAP family member (denoted IQGAP-related protein: Iqg1). Iqg1 and IQGAPs share similarity along their entire length, with an amino-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domain, IQ repeats, and a conserved carboxyl terminus. In contrast to IQGAPs, Iqg1 lacks an identifiable GAP motif, a WW domain, and IR repeats, although the functions of these domains in IQGAPs are not well defined. Deletion of the IQG1 gene resulted in lethality. Cellular defects included a deficiency in cytokinesis, altered actin organization, aberrant nuclear segregation, and cell lysis. The primary defect appeared to be a cytokinesis defect, and the other problems possibly arose as a consequence of this initial defect. Consistent with a role in cytokinesis, Iqg1 co-localizes with an actin ring encircling the mother-bud neck late in the cell cycle -a putative cytokinetic ring. IQG1 overexpression resulted in premature actin-ring formation, suggesting that Iqg1 activity temporally controls formation of this structure during the cell cycle.",

    "context": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in cancer initiation, relapse and metastasis. To date, no specific medicine has been found to target CSCs as they are resistant to most conventional therapies and proliferate indefinitely. Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) has been widely used for cancer patients with remarkable therapeutic effects in Chinese clinical settings for many years. This study focused on whether CKI could inhibit MCF-7 SP cells in vitro and in vivo. The analysis of CKI on SP population and the main genes of Wnt signaling pathway were studied first. Then we studied the tumorigenicity of SP cells and the effects of CKI on SP cells in vivo. The mice inoculated with 10,000 SP cells were randomly divided into three groups (6 in each group) and treated with CKI, cisplatin and saline (as a control) respectively for 7 weeks. The tumor formation rates of each group were compared. The main genes and proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot. CKI suppressed the size of SP population (approximately 90%), and down-regulated the main genes of Wnt signaling pathway. We also determined that MCF-7 SP cells were more tumorigenic than non-SP and unsorted cells. The Wnt signaling pathway was up-regulated in tumors derived from SP cells compared with that in tumors from non-SP cells. The tumor formation rate of the CKI Group was 33% (2/6, P < 0.05), and that of Cisplatin Group was 50%(3/6, P < 0.05), whereas that of the Control Group was 100% (6/6).The RT-PCR and western blot results indicated that CKI suppressed tumor growth by down-regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while cisplatin activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and might spare SP cells.",

    "instruction": "Does ischemic preconditioning enhance hepatocyte proliferation in the early phase after ischemia under hemi-hepatectomy in rats?",
    "context": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important barrier to liver surgery and transplantation because it impairs remnant liver/reduced-size-graft regeneration. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), as an effective measure to overcome I/R injury, has been shown to enhance the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes. However, investigations have always focused on regeneration in the late phase after reperfusion. This study aimed to investigate whether IPC enhances hepatocyte proliferation in the early phase after reperfusion and possible underlying mechanisms. A total of 90 rats were divided into three groups: hemi-hepatectomy alone (PHx group), 60 minutes of ischemia plus hemi-hepatectomy (I/R group), and a cycle of 10 minutes of alternating I/R prior to 60 minutes of ischemia plus hemi-hepatectomy (IPC group). Each group was divided into five subgroups sacrificed after 0.5, 2, 6, 12 or 24 hours (n=6/subgroup). Subsequently, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured; caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) proteins were also determined by Western blotting. Furthermore, PCNA was detected by immunohistochemistry to identify the expression site. Serum ALT and AST levels after 2-24 hours of reperfusion in the PHx and IPC groups were remarkably decreased compared to the I/R group, and the serum TNF-alpha was relatively lower. A significant increase of serum IL-6 levels was found in the PHx and IPC groups compared with the I/R group at each time point. Furthermore, PCNA expression was remarkably increased in the IPC group after 6-12 hours of reperfusion, and in the earlier 0.5 and 6 hours time points after reperfusion have shown the massive PCNA-positive hepatocytes. At the same time, the expression of liver p-JNK was higher in the IPC group in the early phase after reperfusion than that of the I/R group and its expression was consistent with the PCNA.",

We hypothesized that HDL vasculoprotective actions on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may decrease hemorrhagic transformation-associated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration in acute stroke. We used tPA alone or in combination with HDLs in vivo in 2 models of focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (embolic and 4-hour monofilament MCAO) and in vitro in a model of BBB. Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to MCAO, n=12 per group. The rats were then randomly injected with tPA (10 mg/kg) or saline with or without human plasma purified-HDL (10 mg/kg). The therapeutic effects of HDL and BBB integrity were assessed blindly 24 hours later. The integrity of the BBB was also tested using an in vitro model of human cerebral endothelial cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation. tPA-treated groups had significantly higher mortality and rate of hemorrhagic transformation at 24 hours in both MCAO models. Cotreatment with HDL significantly reduced stroke-induced mortality versus tPA alone (by 42% in filament MCAO, P=0.009; by 73% in embolic MCAO, P=0.05) and tPA-induced intracerebral parenchymal hematoma (by 92% in filament MCAO, by 100% in embolic MCAO; P<0.0001).

Here we have determined whether 2-MS antagonised osteoclast development and bone resorption. RAW264.7 cells were treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) to induce differentiation into osteoclasts. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyse osteoclast-associated gene expression and signalling pathways. The number of multinuclear osteoclasts, actin rings and resorption pit formation were markedly inhibited by 2-MS, targeting osteoclast differentiation at an early stage and without significant cytotoxicity. The anti-resorption effect of 2-MS was accompanied by decreasing dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA expression. RANKL-increased MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was also attenuated by concurrent, but not by subsequent addition of 2-MS. 2-MS markedly inhibited not only the RANKL-triggered nuclear translocations of NF-kappaB, c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), but also the subsequent NFATc1 induction. Degradation of IkappaB and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were also suppressed. RANKL facilitated the formation of signaling complexes of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TRAF6-TAK1), important for osteoclastogenesis and formation of such signalling complexes was prevented by 2-MS.",

    "instruction": "Does supplementing desflurane with intravenous anesthesia reduce fetal cardiac dysfunction during open fetal surgery?",
    "context": "To lower the incidence and severity of fetal cardiovascular depression during maternal fetal surgery under general anesthesia. We hypothesized that supplemental intravenous anesthesia (SIVA) with propofol and remifentanil would lower the need for high-dose inhalational anesthesia and provide adequate maternal depth of anesthesia and uterine relaxation. SIVA technique would minimize prolonged fetal exposure to deep inhalational anesthetics and significant intraoperative fetal cardiovascular depression. Fetal hypoxia and significant fetal hemodynamic changes occur during open fetal surgery because of the challenges such as surgical manipulation, hysterotomy, uterine contractions, and effects of anesthetic drugs. Tocolysis, a vital component of fetal surgery, is usually achieved using volatile anesthetic agents. High concentrations of volatile agents required to provide an appropriate degree of uterine relaxation may cause maternal hypotension and placental hypoperfusion, as well as direct fetal cardiovascular depression. We reviewed medical records of 39 patients who presented for ex utero intrapartum treatment and mid-gestation open fetal surgery between April 2004 and March 2009. Out of 39 patients, three were excluded because of the lack of echocardiographic data; 18 patients received high-concentration desflurane anesthesia and 18 patients had SIVA with desflurane for uterine relaxation. We analyzed the following data: demographics, fetal medical condition, anesthetic drugs, concentration and duration of desflurane, maternal arterial blood pressure, intraoperative fetal echocardiogram, presence of fetal bradycardia, and need for intraoperative fetal resuscitation. Adequate uterine relaxation was achieved with about 1.5 MAC of desflurane in the SIVA group compared to about 2.5 MAC in the desflurane only anesthesia group (P = 0.0001). More fetuses in the high-dose desflurane group compared to the SIVA group developed moderate-severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction over time intraoperatively (P = 0.02). 61% of fetuses in the high-dose desflurane group received fetal resuscitative interventions compared to 26% of fetuses in the SIVA group (P = 0.0489).",

ZF rats or their lean littermates received normal diet or supplemented with Provinols for 8 weeks. Provinols improved glucose metabolism by reducing plasma glucose and fructosamine in ZF rats. Moreover, it reduced circulating triglycerides and total cholesterol as well as LDL-cholesterol in ZF rats. Echocardiography measurements demonstrated that Provinols improved cardiac performance as evidenced by an increase in left ventricular fractional shortening and cardiac output associated with decreased peripheral arterial resistances in ZF rats. Regarding vascular function, Provinols corrected endothelial dysfunction in aortas from ZF rats by improving endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine (Ach). Provinols enhanced NO bioavailability resulting from increased nitric oxide (NO) production through enhanced endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) activity and reduced superoxide anion release via decreased expression of NADPH oxidase membrane sub-unit, Nox-1.

    "instruction": "Does neonatal ureteral obstruction alter expression of renal sodium transporters and aquaporin water channels?",
    "context": "Congenital urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of renal insufficiency in the neonate and during infancy. Recently, we demonstrated that ureteral obstruction in adult rats is associated with reduction in the abundance of renal aquaporins (AQPs) and renal sodium transporters, which paralleled an impaired urinary concentrating capacity. In the present study, renal handling of sodium and water, together with the expression of renal aquaporins and major renal sodium transporters, was examined in rats with neonatally induced partial unilateral ureteral obstruction (PUUO) within the first 48 hours of life to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the tubular functional defects in response to congenital obstruction. Rats were then followed for 12 or 24 weeks. Neonatal PUUO caused a progressive reduction in single kidney glomerular filtration rate (SKGFR) on the obstructed side to 43% of controls at 12 weeks (115 +/- 28 vs. 267 +/- 36 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05), and 31% of controls at 24 weeks (106 +/- 24 vs. 343 +/- 41 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05). Na-K-ATPase abundance was decreased in the obstructed kidney compared with the nonobstructed kidney at 24 weeks (79 +/- 6%, P < 0.05), and the abundance of bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (BSC-1) located to the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) of the obstructed kidney was significantly reduced both at 12 weeks (42 +/- 10%, P < 0.05) and 24 weeks (50 +/- 10%, P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry confirmed down-regulation of BSC-1 both at 12 and 24 weeks after onset of obstruction. Consistent with this, sodium excretion from the obstructed kidney was increased at 12 weeks (0.13 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 micromol/min/100g bw, P < 0.05), and persisted 24 weeks after onset of PUUO (0.15 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.01 micromol/min/100g bw, P < 0.05). AQP2 abundance in the collecting duct was also reduced both at 12 weeks (68 +/- 5%, P < 0.05) and at 24 weeks (69 +/- 13%, P < 0.05). Consistent with this, solute-free water reabsorption was decreased in the obstructed kidney at 12 weeks (0.61 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.63 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05) and remained decreased after 24 weeks of PUUO (0.42 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.56 +/- 0.39 microL/min/100g bw, P < 0.05).",
    "response": "Major sodium transporters and aquaporins in the obstructed kidney are down-regulated in response to neonatally induced PUUO, which indicates that these transporters may play a crucial role for the persistent reduction in renal handling of sodium and water in response to PUUO.",

    "context": "Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a gastric cancer precursor lesion (GCPL) and an extremely high risk factor for progression to gastric cancer (GC). Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with extensive IM undergo a gastroscopy every 3 years. However, protein biomarkers that indicate a transition from IM to GC are lacking. Our group recently identified an interferon-alpha (IFNα)-responsive gene, Schlafen 4 (Slfn4), in immune cells that correlates with metaplastic changes in Helicobacter-infected mice. We therefore tested the hypothesis that a human homolog of Slfn4, namely, Schlafen 5 (SLFN5), correlates with progression of GCPL to GC. Jurkat T-lymphoid and HL-60 myeloid cell lines were treated with IFNα, and SLFN5 mRNA was quantified by quantitative PCR. SLFN5 protein expression in the inflamed gastric mucosa was co-localized to specific immune cell types by immunohistochemistry using CD20, CD2, and MAC2 antibodies. SLFN5 expression was also determined by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from individuals with non-atrophic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, complete IM, incomplete IM, and GC, respectively. The IFNα treatment of Jurkat and HL-60 cells induced SLFN5 mRNA. SLFN5 protein was expressed mainly by T lymphocytes in inflamed gastric mucosa. The highest level of SLFN5 expression was observed in patients with IM that progressed to GC. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that correlating SLFN5 expression with the histologic diagnosis of IM significantly increased the probability of identifying patients who may progress to GC.",

    "context": "Prostate development and maintenance in the adult results from an interaction of stromal and glandular components. Androgens can drive this process by direct action on the stroma. We investigated whether there was a direct link between androgens and another key regulator of stromal cells, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ). Prostate stromal cells were freshly obtained and cultures derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression in dihydrotestosterone treated and untreated cells was compared using Affymetrix gene expression arrays and Ca2+ regulated features were identified by Gene Ontology (GO). Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined in Fluo-4 loaded cells. Androgen regulation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitaion. Stromal cell cultures were sorted for expression of integrin α1 β1 , which enriched for cells expressing the androgen receptor (AR). We identified key functional categories, within the androgen-induced gene expression signature, focusing on genes involved in calcium signaling. From this analysis, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) was identified as a significantly differentially expressed gene with four relevant associated GO terms. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region of STIM1 contained putative androgen response element sequences in which AR binding ability of STIM1 was confirmed. Androgens directly regulated STIM1 expression and STIM1 effects on store-operated calcium entry were inhibited by STIM1 knock-down. Reduced STIM1 expression in prostate stromal cells led to a reduction in basal Ca2+ levels, the amount of Ca2+ released by thapsigargin and a reduction in store filling following TG-induced store depletion.",

Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) is the last enzyme for SM de novo biosynthesis. Two SMS genes, SMS1 and SMS2, have been cloned and characterized. To evaluate the in vivo role of SMS2 in SM metabolism, we prepared SMS2 knockout (KO) and SMS2 liver-specific transgenic (LTg) mice and studied their plasma SM and lipoprotein metabolism. On a chow diet, SMS2 KO mice showed a significant decrease in plasma SM levels (25%, P<0.05), but no significant changes in total cholesterol, total phospholipids, or triglyceride, compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. On a high-fat diet, SMS2 KO mice showed a decrease in plasma SM levels (28%, P<0.01), whereas SMS2LTg mice showed a significant increase in those levels (29%, P<0.05), but no significant changes in other lipids, compared with WT littermates. Atherogenic lipoproteins from SMS2LTg mice displayed a significantly stronger tendency toward aggregation after mammalian sphingomyelinase treatment, compared with controls. Moreover, SMS2 deficiency significantly increased plasma apoE levels (2.0-fold, P<0.001), whereas liver-specific SMS2 overexpression significantly decreased those levels (1.8-fold, P<0.01). Finally, SMS2 KO mouse plasma promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages, whereas SMS2LTg mouse plasma prevented it.",

Since the salt-sensitive rat and salt-resistant rat were bred from the Sprague Dawley rat, the aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that salt-resistant and Sprague Dawley rats would be similar in their vitamin D endocrine system response to high salt intake. Sprague Dawley, salt-sensitive, and salt-resistant rats were fed high (80 g/kg, 8%) or low (3 g/kg, 3%) salt diets for three weeks. The blood pressure of Sprague Dawley rats increased from baseline to week 3 during both high and low salt intake and the mean blood pressure at week 3 of high salt intake was higher than that at week 3 of low salt intake (P < 0.05). Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (marker of vitamin D status) of Sprague Dawley, salt-sensitive, and salt-resistant rats were similar at week 3 of low salt intake. Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of Sprague Dawley and salt-resistant rats were unaffected by high salt intake, whereas the mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of salt-sensitive rats at week 3 of high salt intake was only 20% of that at week 3 of low salt intake.",

Potential efficacy of ImmuBalance™, which is the fermented soy product, on treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) was investigated using a mouse model for human AD, NC/Tnd mice. For in vivo study, ImmuBalance containing chow or a control diet were fed to NC/Tnd mice with moderate dermatitis for 2 weeks. Topical application of FK506 ointment was used as a positive control. Clinical skin severity scores, scratching behaviors, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and histological features were analyzed. For in vitro study, suppressive effect of ImmuBalance™ on nerve growth factor (NGF)-activated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was examined. Clinical skin severity scores of the mice fed with ImmuBalance containing chow were gradually reduced as well as the mice treated with FK506. Feeding with ImmuBalance completely inhibited the increase in scratching behavior of NC/Tnd mice. The value of TEWL of NC/Tnd mice fed with ImmuBalance was significantly decreased. In addition, histological examination revealed that application of ImmuBalance decreased the number of PGP9.5-positive neuronal fibers in the lesional skin.

However, these alterations and their affected molecular pathways remain uncharacterized. Disease progression is known to transform skeletal muscle fiber composition by unknown mechanisms. In addition, perturbation of specific hormonal pathways, including those involving skeletal muscle insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFB-5) appears to occur, likely affecting muscle metabolism and regeneration. We hypothesized that changes in IGF-1 and IGFB-5 mRNA levels correlate with the transformation of single-skeletal muscle fiber myosin heavy chain isoforms early in disease progression, making these molecules valuable markers of skeletal muscle changes in heart failure. To investigate these molecules during \"early\" events in HF patients, we obtained skeletal muscle biopsies from New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II HF patients and controls for molecular analyses of single fibers, and we also quantified isometric strength and muscle size. There were more (P < 0.05) single muscle fibers coexpressing two or more myosin heavy chains in the HF patients (30% ± 7%) compared to the control subjects (13% ± 2%). IGF-1 and IGFBP-5 expression was fivefold and 15-fold lower in patients with in HF compared to control subjects (P < 0.05), respectively. Strikingly, there was a correlation in IGF-1 expression and muscle cross-sectional area (P < 0.05) resulting in a decrease in whole-muscle quality (P < 0.05) in the HF patients, despite no significant decrease in isometric strength or whole-muscle size.",

    "context": "Relatively recent evidence indicates that ABCC2 transporters play a main role in the mode of action of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1A-type proteins. Mapping of major Cry1A resistance genes has linked resistance to the ABCC2 locus in Heliothis virescens, Plutella xylostella, Trichoplusia ni and Bombyx mori, and mutations in this gene have been found in three of these Bt-resistant strains. We have used a colony of Spodoptera exigua (Xen-R) highly resistant to a Bt commercial bioinsecticide to identify regions in the S. exigua genome containing loci for major resistance genes by using bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Results reveal a region containing three genes from the ABCC family (ABBC1, ABBC2 and ABBC3) and a mutation in one of them (ABBC2) as responsible for the resistance of S. exigua to the Bt commercial product and to its key Spodoptera-active ingredients, Cry1Ca. In contrast to all previously described mutations in ABCC2 genes that directly or indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the ABCC2 mutation found in S. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in ATP binding. Functional analyses of ABBC2 and ABBC3 support the role of both proteins in the mode of action of Bt toxins in S. exigua. Partial silencing of these genes with dsRNA decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. In addition, reduction of ABBC2 and ABBC3 expression negatively affected some fitness components and induced up-regulation of arylphorin and repat5, genes that respond to Bt intoxication and that are found constitutively up-regulated in the Xen-R strain.",

Each dobutamine stress echocardiogram was assessed at every institution regarding endocardial visibility and left ventricular wall motion without knowledge of any other data using standardized reading criteria. No patients were excluded due to poor image quality or inadequate stress level. Coronary angiography was performed within 4 weeks. Coronary angiography demonstrated significant coronary artery disease (> or = 50% diameter stenosis) in 87 patients.

The RIZ1 form is usually absent or expressed at low levels in tumor cells, whereas RIZ2 is frequently expressed. We investigated a possible involvement of RIZ1 in differentiation control using a myeloid cell maturation model that is easily modulated by retinoids and other agents. HL60 or NB4 cell lines or patients' leukemic promyelocytes were treated with all- trans -retinoic acid or other agents to induce differentiation. RIZ gene expression was determined with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNase protection assay. Immunocytochemistry was performed to assess variation of the intracellular distribution of RIZ protein on all- trans-retinoic acid treatment. Forced expression of RIZ1 protein was obtained with a recombinant adenovirus containing RIZ1 cDNA. Treatment with retinoic acid induced a selective expression of RIZ1 in HL60 cell line. Retinoic acid effect was maximal at 7 days and correlated to the granulocytic differentiation of cells. A similar effect was obtained in retinoic acid-sensitive NB4 cell line or in patients' leukemic promyelocytes, but not in the retinoic acid-resistant cell line NB4.007/6 or in the U937 cell line. Selective expression of RIZ1 was also induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in the U937 and HL60 cell lines and by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) only in HL60 cells. In HL60 cells, RIZ1 was also induced by activation of a retinoid alpha receptor-independent maturation pathway based on retinoid X receptor agonist and protein kinase A synergism. In addition, retinoic acid produced a redistribution of the antigen within the nucleus in these cells. Forced expression of RIZ1 protein induced growth arrest and death of HL60 cells.",

To discover whether antihypertensive treatment with an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker is accompanied by an increase in sympathoadrenomedullary activity, we studied plasma catecholamine kinetics before and during treatment with doxazosin. Eleven patients with essential hypertension were studied before and after 3 months' treatment with doxazosin (4-8 mg a day). 3H-noradrenaline and 3H-adrenaline were infused simultaneously and blood samples were collected to calculate plasma catecholamine kinetics before and during sympatho-adrenomedullary stimulation (lower-body negative pressure).

Serine proteinase gene expression in femoral head cartilage obtained from either patients with hip OA or patients with fracture to the neck of the femur (NOF) was assessed using a low-density array. The effect of matriptase on collagen breakdown was determined in cartilage degradation models, while the effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. ProMMP processing was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/N-terminal sequencing, while its ability to activate proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) was determined using a synovial perfusion assay in mice. Matriptase gene expression was significantly elevated in OA cartilage compared with NOF cartilage, and matriptase was immunolocalized to OA chondrocytes. We showed that matriptase activated proMMP-1 and processed proMMP-3 to its fully active form. Exogenous matriptase significantly enhanced cytokine-stimulated cartilage collagenolysis, while matriptase alone caused significant collagenolysis from OA cartilage, which was metalloproteinase-dependent. Matriptase also induced MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression.

    "context": "Mutations in ABCC6 underlie the ectopic mineralization disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and some forms of generalized arterial calcification of infancy, both of which affect the cardiovascular system. Using cultured cells, we recently showed that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6) mediates the cellular release of ATP, which is extracellularly rapidly converted into AMP and the mineralization inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The current study was performed to determine which tissues release ATP in an ABCC6-dependent manner in vivo, where released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi, and whether human PXE ptients have low plasma PPi concentrations. Using cultured primary hepatocytes and in vivo liver perfusion experiments, we found that ABCC6 mediates the direct, sinusoidal, release of ATP from the liver. Outside hepatocytes, but still within the liver vasculature, released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi. The absence of functional ABCC6 in patients with PXE leads to strongly reduced plasma PPi concentrations.",
    "response": "Hepatic ABCC6-mediated ATP release is the main source of circulating PPi, revealing an unanticipated role of the liver in systemic PPi homeostasis. Patients with PXE have a strongly reduced plasma PPi level, explaining their mineralization disorder. Our results indicate that systemic PPi is relatively stable and that PXE, generalized arterial calcification of infancy, and other ectopic mineralization disorders could be treated with PPi supplementation therapy.",

    "instruction": "Does 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor activation contribute to ziprasidone-induced dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex?",
    "context": "Ziprasidone (Zeldox) is a novel antipsychotic with a unique combination of antagonist activities at monoaminergic receptors and transporters and potent agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors. 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism may be an important feature in ziprasidone's clinical actions because 5-HT(1A) agonists increase cortical dopamine release, which may underlie efficacy against negative symptoms and reduce dopamine D(2) antagonist-induced extrapyramidal side effects. This study investigated the in vivo 5-HT(1A) agonist activity of ziprasidone by measuring the contribution of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation to the ziprasidone-induced cortical dopamine release in rats. Effects on dopamine release were measured by microdialysis in prefrontal cortex and striatum. The role of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation was estimated by assessing the sensitivity of the response to pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635. For comparison, the D(2)/5-HT(2A) antagonists clozapine and olanzapine, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol, the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 and the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT were included. Low doses (<3.2 mg/kg) of ziprasidone, clozapine, and olanzapine increased dopamine release to approximately the same extent in prefrontal cortex as in striatum, but higher doses (> or =3.2 mg/kg) resulted in an increasingly preferential effect on cortical dopamine release. The 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT produced a robust increase in cortical dopamine (DA) release without affecting striatal DA release. In contrast, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol selectively increased striatal DA release, whereas the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 had no effect on cortical or striatal DA release. Prior administration of WAY-100635 completely blocked the cortical DA increase produced by 8-OHDPAT and significantly attenuated the ziprasidone- and clozapine-induced cortical DA increase. WAY-100635 pretreatment had no effect on the olanzapine-induced DA increase.",
    "response": "The preferential increase in DA release in rat prefrontal cortex produced by ziprasidone is mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptor activation. This result extends and confirms other in vitro and in vivo data suggesting that ziprasidone, like clozapine, acts as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist in vivo, which may contribute to its activity as an antipsychotic with efficacy against negative symptoms and a low extrapyramidal side effect liability.",

    "context": "Tomato contains a variety of phenolics associated with health-promoting properties. However, the effects of processing and the addition of oil during tomato sauce preparation on microbial metabolism of phenolics in the small intestine are still unclear. An open, controlled, randomized, and crossover feeding trial with 40 healthy volunteers was carried out to analyze the metabolites in plasma and urine after the consumption of tomato and tomato sauces, with tomato sauce enriched with refined olive oil (ROOE) and without refined olive oil (oil-free: OF). Ten phenolics in plasma and 93 metabolites in urine were quantified. Processing tomatoes into sauce enhanced the bioavailability of flavanones, flavanols, and some hydroxycinnamic acids, as reflected by the increase in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve. An increase in their plasma half-life was also observed, particularly after ingestion of ROOE, possibly favored by enterohepatic circulation. A wide variety of gut microbial metabolites was also detected, namely flavanones, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, hydroxyphenylpropanoic acids, hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and hydroxybenzoic acids.",
    "response": "Flavanones and flavonols in ROOE presented higher bioavailability, suggesting that the processing undergone by the raw tomato improved their absorption.",

    "context": "Various studies have indicated that malnutrition and chronic inflammation are strong predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between pulmonary function, malnutrition and chronic inflammation in patients with CKD. One hundred and six consenting patients with CKD were enrolled in the study between 2005 and 2007. Pulmonary function was assessed by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) and peak expiratory flow (PEF), expressed as the normal percentage of predicted values (%FEV(1), %FVC and %PEF, respectively). Nutritional status was evaluated by skeletal muscle index (SMI), subjective global nutritional assessment (SGA), lean body mass, body mass index and serum albumin. Inflammation was assessed by the serum measurement of high-sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Malnutrition (defined as SMI > or =1) and inflammation (defined as hsCRP >2 mg/l) in ESRD patients had significant negative associations with percentage predicted values for pulmonary function tests except %PEF (SMI: %FEV(1), p = 0.009, %FVC, p = 0.001; hsCRP: %FEV(1), p = 0.025, %FVC, p = 0.022). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the ejection fraction in echocardiography and SGA were associated with poor survival, but there was no association for %FEV(1).",

    "context": "To determine if echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) performed at rest detects reduced myocardial function in patients with reversible ischaemia. Eighty-four patients with angina pectoris, no previous history of ischaemic heart disease and normal left ventricular ejection fraction were examined with colour TDI, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and coronary angiography (CAG). Patients with a normal SPECT (n= 42) constituted the control group and patients with a positive SPECT (n= 42) were divided into patients with (true-positive SPECT, n= 30) or without (false-positive SPECT, n= 12) significant coronary stenoses assessed by CAG. Regional longitudinal systolic (s'), early diastolic (e'), and late diastolic (a') myocardial velocities were measured by colour TDI at six mitral annular sites and averaged to provide global estimates. In patients with reversible ischaemia both global systolic and diastolic function were impaired in terms of reduced average s' (5.6 ± 0.9 vs. 6.1 ± 1.1 cm/s; P< 0.05), reduced average e' (5.9 ± 1.8 vs. 7.0 ± 1.7 cm/s; P< 0.01) and increased average E/e' (14.2 ± 5.0 vs. 11.5 ± 3.9; P< 0.01). This impairment of the cardiac function was even more evident in patients with a true-positive SPECT with reduced average s' (5.5 ± 0.8 vs. 6.1 ± 1.1 cm/s; P< 0.01), reduced average e' (5.2 ± 1.5 vs. 7.0 ± 1.7 cm/s; P< 0.001), and increased average E/e' (15.5 ± 5.2 vs. 11.5 ± 3.9; P< 0.001), whereas no difference in myocardial velocities could be demonstrated in patients with a false-positive SPECT compared with controls.",
    "response": "In patients with stable angina pectoris, preserved ejection fraction, and reversible ischaemia assessed by SPECT, echocardiographic colour TDI performed at rest reveals impaired cardiac function. The impairment of the cardiac function seems to be evident only in patients with a true-positive SPECT and colour TDI may therefore increase its diagnostic value.",

    "context": "EMLA cream is an effective topical anesthetic, which is commonly used for analgesia during venous cannulation in the pediatric population. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of EMLA cream with that of infiltration with lidocaine in relieving the pain associated with administration of spinal anesthesia. The patient population consisted of 41 ASA status I and II women scheduled for postpartum tubal ligation. Spinal anesthesia was administered with a 25-gauge spinal needle via a 20-gauge introducer. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either EMLA cream for a minimum of 30 minutes or infiltration with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine prior to spinal needle insertion. Pain during spinal needle insertion was assessed immediately after each procedure by a 10-cm visual analog scale. Pain scores were significantly lower in the EMLA group (mean, 1.5) than in the lidocaine group (mean, 3.52) (P < .001). The number of patients satisfied with the method of analgesia was significantly higher in the EMLA than in the lidocaine group (90% vs 55%, P < .05).",

    "context": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the expression of p75 nerve growth factor receptor (p75NGFR) in human cross-facial nerve grafts and to compare the immunohistological findings with patient data and the functional outcome in facial reanimation. The study comprised 37 sural nerve graft specimens. All of the patients had long-lasting complete facial paralysis and were operated on by the standard two-stage procedure involving cross-facial nerve grafts and microneurovascular muscle transfer. Nerve biopsies were taken 4 to 20 months (mean, 8 months) after the cross-facial nerve grafting. Immunohistochemistry for p75NGFR as well as for Schwann cells (S-100; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and for Neurofilament-200 (NF-200; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) was performed. In graft biopsies, the mean number of NF-200-positive axons amounted to 38% (range, 6-81%) of that in control samples. Further, regenerated axons were thinner than in control samples. Morphologically, the grafted nerves were characterized by fibrosis and invasion of inflammatory cells. A longer time between cross-facial nerve grafting and biopsy sampling correlated with a higher number of viable axons (NF-200) (P = 0.002). In all cases, expression of p75NGF receptor was clearly higher at the distal end of the grafted nerve. Expression of p75NGFR was lower in older than in younger patients (P = 0.003). A high expression of p75NGFR was often seen with better function of the transplanted muscle.",
    "response": "Increased expression of p75NGFR in human nerve grafts was noted, especially in younger patients. We suggest that p75NGFR expression might be a contributing factor in a successful axonal regeneration and eventual recovery of muscle function.",

    "context": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease prevalent in elderly men. However, the genetic determinants of BPH remain unclear. Because BPH and prostate cancer (PCa) share some common pathological characteristics, we investigated whether susceptibility loci for PCa contributed to BPH risk and BPH aggressiveness in Chinese men. Fourteen SNPs associated with PCa risk in a Chinese population were genotyped in 426 BPH cases (184 aggressive and 242 non-aggressive BPH cases) and 1,008 controls. The association between the SNPs and BPH risk/aggressiveness was estimated using logistic regression analysis. In addition, effects of the 14 SNPs on BPH related clinical traits, including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, total PSA, and free PSA were evaluated using linear regression analysis. Two SNPs, rs12621278 in ITGA6 at 2q31 (OR = 0.82, P = 0.05) and rs339331 in RFX6 at 6q22 (OR = 1.22, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with BPH.

    "context": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) structural core and non-structural NS5A proteins induce in liver cells a series of intracellular events, including elevation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Since oxidative stress is associated to altered intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, we aimed to investigate the effect of these proteins on Ca(2+) mobilization in human hepatocyte-derived transfected cells, and the protective effect of quercetin treatment. Ca(2+) mobilization and actin reorganization were determined by spectrofluorimetry. Production of ROS/RNS was determined by flow cytometry. Cells transfected with NS5A and core proteins showed enhanced ROS/RNS production and resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, and reduced Ca(2+) concentration into the stores. Phenylephrine-evoked Ca(2+) release, Ca(2+) entry and extrusion by the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase were significantly reduced in transfected cells. Similar effects were observed in cytokine-activated cells. Phenylephrine-evoked actin reorganization was reduced in the presence of core and NS5A proteins. These effects were significantly prevented by quercetin. Altered Ca(2+) mobilization and increased calpain activation were observed in replicon-containing cells.",
