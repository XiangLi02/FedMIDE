The pain can in fact be related as both are in and near the pelvis, so it is normal for some time to get the pains as you described.

The trauma or fall can have injury to disc, if you directly fell on your back.2. If you have pinching sensation behind your knees, the disc is pressing on the nerves and may be causing radiating pain in the nerves.3. Due to disc problem, you may have difficulty in moving your hips.4. Standing and walking will put more pressure on the disc and nerves.5. Please consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and do an MRI. If the disc is pressing the nerves, i.e. radiculopathy, you may need surgical treatment. It is possible that your earlier Lumbar disc problem has increased with the fall.6. Please consult your orthopedic surgeon again and explain your problems. If the chiropractor had advised treatment, and it is not helping, you should inform immediately. Wish you the best recovery",

So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mid/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mid/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today. ",

Uncontrolled bleeding is one of important complication of this surgery, and it may lead to electrolyte abnormalities and consequent development of seizure. Due to significant blood loss she is having complaints of palpitation and difficulty in breathing. Due to seizure injury to muscles occurs, and it leads to release of myoglobin (muscle pigment) from muscles to blood and which causes brown urine and severe muscle pains. At present, she is on anti seizure medicine and continue giving the medicines, her other complaints will improve once her blood Hemoglobin levels and electrolyte levels will come in normal range.

        "response": "HelloThanks for your query. After going through your query I came to know that your husband is probably suffering from lumbar disc prolapse. It can be confirmed by MRI scan. There are two treatment options. First option is rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both hip and knee bend), neurotopics such as mecobalamin and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as tramadol three times a day after meals) is required. Omeprazole before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy).  You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link:https://www.bit.ly/ask Chat Doctor. Take care.",

In case of infection he can advise taking antibiotics like Augmenting, anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen, clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply triple antibiotic ointment over it. You can also do cool compresses over it. If infection is severe injectable antibiotics can be advised. Keep the area away from water and moisture and maintain Chat Doctor. .

        "response": "Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

        "response": "Hello Mr Raft. Welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. And medical treatment may not help you much. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may continue Maintop solution to scalp as advised, along with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Improvement will not be visible within a week. Since you have been on treatment since a long time, with not much improvement, do consult a dermatologist, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. If medical methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, smoking, get good rest. Hope this guides you.",

The treatment depends on the severity of the injury and in your case, it would take at least 6-8 weeks for complete recovery.

        "response": "Hi, (Actually, the proper spelling is Rheumatism, not dogmatism).  Rheumatism is not a single disease, it is a group of disorders that cause inflammation in joints, muscles and/or other soft tissues. There are several diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, SHE, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Gout, etc. and all of them are a kind of Rheumatism.  Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis.  Some Rheumatic disorders only involve one joint and some others involve other joints and even other parts of the body such as kidney, heart, etc. The major treatment for these disorders are the Chat Doctor.  Although other treatments also exist. In most cases, rheumatic diseases cannot be totally cured, but with the help of proper medication the pain and other problems will go away, and the disease will be off for a long time.  I suggest that if the doctor that you saw was not an Internal Medicine specialist or a Rheumatologist, you refer to another doctor to be sure that your problem is hematologic.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

        "response": "Hi, as you mentioned with your difficulty in breathing with is increasing as days are passing. So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. ",

This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest damage to the brain which is commonly found in child Chat Doctor.  These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc. If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy.

Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist.",

In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count.

        "response": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that this racing heart has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates in parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. They cause premature heart contraction or chaotic rhythm that's not a normal one. It might be what we call extra beats or arrhythmia like supra ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation etc. The causes of this rhythm issues might be different like simple emotional stress, coffee or alcohol consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances or cardiac pathologies. In this situation you might experience palpitation, strong beating, heart racing, dizziness, difficulties in breathing deeply. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, hyperthyroidism, a holder rhythm monitoring to evaluate your rhythm tendency. Only after this we can better understand what we are dealing with and if it is necessary to treat it. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards, Chat Doctor. ",

The two differential diagnosis here are IGA Nephropathy and Post Infectious Glomerulonephritis. Only a biopsy can differentiate the two or clarify if the problem is something totally different.

Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. ",

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

CT scan is to be avoided in those younger than 15 years of age because of the radiation dose. In a CT scan the dose is equivalent to 200 X-rays. This is a high dose and should be avoided unless there is an obvious benefit arising by doing such an investigation. Research shows that those kids having exposed to two or more CT scans below 15 years of age have a twofold risk of developing leukemia later in life. However since you child got only X-ray done hence there is no concern for radiation exposure. Please do not worry.",

        "context": "",
        "response": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

The decreased hearing in the ear may be due to infection in the ear or dysfunction of the Eustachian tube (tube in the ear). Loss of appetite, coughing, chills can occur with these infections. If the cough is wet, then a bucolic can be used to break up the mucus so that it can be expelled. e.g. bipolar, Mucomyst, guaifenesinA decongestant with antihistamine may also help.

Ideally, you should start taking the combined pills on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. If you start the pill after the fifth day of your period, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraceptives such as condoms until you have taken the pill for seven days. It is okay to start taking the white or inactive pill by mistake since you have taken the active or beige pills later on. Continue to take a beige pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished. Then take those six white or inactive pills (during these days you will get a bleed).  Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care ",

        "instruction": "Hi, I ve been working with Xylene for 6 years. During this time (within first year) I developed Fibromyelgia, Chronic Fatigue, Anxiety, a feeling that I ve lost some sensation and co-ordination in my hands and patches of skin that occasionally become supersensitive. I used to feel intoxicated while working in the lab but by the time I got home was super aggressive and angry. I no longer feel intoxicated when working with it. After 4 years I noticed when working with Xylene my face began to burn/itch. In the last two weeks I have developed irritation in the Trachea immediately after commencing a major project with Xylene. It settles down when I go home but immediately on entering the lab the trachea gets irritated and I cough. How do I know if it is the Xylene causing me problems?",
        "context": "",
        "response": "Xylene is a pretty toxic organic solvent. It certainly affects the liver, and liver function tests are necessary. Likely also to affect nerves. A nerve conduction test can show if the nerves are sick BUT, there isn't good treatment for it except stop exposure and hope. It would take months for the nerves to correct themselves. Then lung exposure to xylene can cause lung fibrosis. This is testable with lung function tests (x-ray, spirometry, but mainly diffusion testing).",
