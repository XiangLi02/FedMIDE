The pain can in fact be related as both are in and near the pelvis, so it is normal for some time to get the pains as you described.

The trauma or fall can have injury to disc, if you directly fell on your back.2. If you have pinching sensation behind your knees, the disc is pressing on the nerves and may be causing radiating pain in the nerves.3. Due to disc problem, you may have difficulty in moving your hips.4. Standing and walking will put more pressure on the disc and nerves.5. Please consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and do an MRI. If the disc is pressing the nerves, i.e. radiculopathy, you may need surgical treatment. It is possible that your earlier Lumbar disc problem has increased with the fall.6. Please consult your orthopedic surgeon again and explain your problems. If the chiropractor had advised treatment, and it is not helping, you should inform immediately. Wish you the best recovery",

So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mid/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mid/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today. ",

Uncontrolled bleeding is one of important complication of this surgery, and it may lead to electrolyte abnormalities and consequent development of seizure. Due to significant blood loss she is having complaints of palpitation and difficulty in breathing. Due to seizure injury to muscles occurs, and it leads to release of myoglobin (muscle pigment) from muscles to blood and which causes brown urine and severe muscle pains. At present, she is on anti seizure medicine and continue giving the medicines, her other complaints will improve once her blood Hemoglobin levels and electrolyte levels will come in normal range.

        "response": "HelloThanks for your query. After going through your query I came to know that your husband is probably suffering from lumbar disc prolapse. It can be confirmed by MRI scan. There are two treatment options. First option is rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both hip and knee bend), neurotopics such as mecobalamin and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as tramadol three times a day after meals) is required. Omeprazole before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy).  You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link:https://www.bit.ly/ask Chat Doctor. Take care.",

In case of infection he can advise taking antibiotics like Augmenting, anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen, clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply triple antibiotic ointment over it. You can also do cool compresses over it. If infection is severe injectable antibiotics can be advised. Keep the area away from water and moisture and maintain Chat Doctor. .

        "response": "Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

        "response": "Hello Mr Raft. Welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. And medical treatment may not help you much. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may continue Maintop solution to scalp as advised, along with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Improvement will not be visible within a week. Since you have been on treatment since a long time, with not much improvement, do consult a dermatologist, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. If medical methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, smoking, get good rest. Hope this guides you.",

The treatment depends on the severity of the injury and in your case, it would take at least 6-8 weeks for complete recovery.

        "response": "Hi, (Actually, the proper spelling is Rheumatism, not dogmatism).  Rheumatism is not a single disease, it is a group of disorders that cause inflammation in joints, muscles and/or other soft tissues. There are several diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, SHE, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Gout, etc. and all of them are a kind of Rheumatism.  Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis.  Some Rheumatic disorders only involve one joint and some others involve other joints and even other parts of the body such as kidney, heart, etc. The major treatment for these disorders are the Chat Doctor.  Although other treatments also exist. In most cases, rheumatic diseases cannot be totally cured, but with the help of proper medication the pain and other problems will go away, and the disease will be off for a long time.  I suggest that if the doctor that you saw was not an Internal Medicine specialist or a Rheumatologist, you refer to another doctor to be sure that your problem is hematologic.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ",

Does the plug have to be discolored? I do remember a large amount of mucus but it didn t have any discoloration to it.",

        "response": "Hi, I understand your query.  * Vaginal discharge in pregnancy is influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy.  It is a reaction of uterine lining & some normally residing bacteria in vagina. To the pregnancy changes.  It may be scanty or considerable depending on pregnancy hormonal pattern that time. So please do not be tense because the discharge is less.  It is usually thin, colorless, without symptoms.  The moment you start having symptoms like copious, thick, cheesy/green or yellow discharge with itching or burning you should get concerned, consult your doctor immediately * In pregnancy mucus collects at cervix, & comes out as the cervix dilates, It may be clear / pink/ red.  Clear mucus plug indicates beginning of dilatation, & may be followed by labor pains in about 15 days.  Thanks.",

        "response": "Hi, as you mentioned with your difficulty in breathing with is increasing as days are passing. So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. ",

        "instruction": "premature baby born at 28 weeks with low birth weight 10 months now with spastic lower limbs MRI showed: White matter gliosis - PVL . Dilated ventricles with no signs of obstructive hydrocephalus. what does this mean? any signs he will develop cerebral palsy?",
        "context": "",
        "response": "Hi. Thank you for posting your question. Cerebral Palsy is a long term result of any kind of damage to the developing brain. This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest damage to the brain which is commonly found in child Chat Doctor.  These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc. If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy. Apart from these regular follow up and monitoring of your children development and progress would help you decide the next step. Do reply if you need any more guidance.",
