A prerequisite for vascular repair is endothelial cell migration. We evaluated the influence of HCMV on chemokinesis and chemotactic response of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) towards vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A virus dose-dependent reduction in chemokinesis and VEGF-dependent chemotaxis was observed (P < 0.05). UV-inactivated virus did not inhibit chemotaxis or chemokinesis, indicating that viral gene expression is mandatory. We identified two HCMV-induced mechanisms explaining the reduction of chemotaxis: first, a non-ambiguous reduction of VEGFR-2 protein was observed, due to decreased transcription. This protein down-modulation could not be inhibited by Ganciclovir. The remaining VEGFR-2 expressed on infected HCAEC was able to stimulate cell activation. Second, HCMV infection influences actin polymerization in HCAEC as shown by FACS analysis: actin polymerization was significantly reduced to 53 and 51% (P < 0.05) compared with non-infected HCAEC at 24 and 72 h p.i., respectively.

The objective of this study was to determine whether ANGPTL4 E40K and T266M are associated with triglyceride levels in the setting of obesity and T2D, and whether modification of triglyceride levels by these genetic variants is altered by a lifestyle intervention designed to treat T2D.

A one-compartment linear disposition model with first order input and first order elimination was used to describe the data. There were 86 children (weight 9.4, sd 5.5, range 1.9-23 kg; PNA 16.1, sd 22.7, range 0.6-98 months). The population parameter estimate for volume of distribution (V) was 189 l.70 kg(-1).

Tic110 forms one prominent protein translocation channel. Additionally, Tic20, another subunit of the complex, was proposed to form a protein import channel - either together with or independent of Tic110. However, no experimental evidence for Tic20 channel activity has been provided so far. We performed a comprehensive biochemical and electrophysiological study to characterize Tic20 in more detail and to gain a deeper insight into its potential role in protein import into chloroplasts. Firstly, we compared transcript and protein levels of Tic20 and Tic110 in both Pisum sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found the Tic20 protein to be generally less abundant, which was particularly pronounced in Arabidopsis. Secondly, we demonstrated that Tic20 forms a complex larger than 700 kilodalton in the inner envelope membrane, which is clearly separate from Tic110, migrating as a dimer at about 250 kilodalton. Thirdly, we defined the topology of Tic20 in the inner envelope, and found its N- and C-termini to be oriented towards the stromal side. Finally, we successfully reconstituted overexpressed and purified full-length Tic20 into liposomes. Using these Tic20-proteoliposomes, we could demonstrate for the first time that Tic20 can independently form a cation selective channel in vitro.",
        "response": "The presented data provide first biochemical evidence to the notion that Tic20 can act as a channel protein within the chloroplast import translocon complex. However, the very low abundance of Tic20 in the inner envelope membranes indicates that it cannot form a major protein translocation channel. Furthermore, the independent complex formation of Tic20 and Tic110 argues against a joint channel formation. Thus, based on the observed channel activity of Tic20 in proteoliposomes, we speculate that the chloroplast inner envelope contains multiple (at least two) translocation channels: Tic110 as the general translocation pore, whereas Tic20 could be responsible for translocation of a special subset of proteins.",

Direct sequencing confirmed the presence of R. prolixus in palms and that silvatic bugs can colonise houses, with house and palm specimens sharing seven cytb haplotypes. Additionally, mitochondrial introgression was detected between R. robustus and R. prolixus, indicating a previous hybridisation event.

Prostate stromal cells were freshly obtained and cultures derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression in dihydrotestosterone treated and untreated cells was compared using Affymetrix gene expression arrays and Ca2+ regulated features were identified by Gene Ontology (GO). Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined in Fluo-4 loaded cells. Androgen regulation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitaion. Stromal cell cultures were sorted for expression of integrin α1 β1 , which enriched for cells expressing the androgen receptor (AR). We identified key functional categories, within the androgen-induced gene expression signature, focusing on genes involved in calcium signaling. From this analysis, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) was identified as a significantly differentially expressed gene with four relevant associated GO terms. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region of STIM1 contained putative androgen response element sequences in which AR binding ability of STIM1 was confirmed. Androgens directly regulated STIM1 expression and STIM1 effects on store-operated calcium entry were inhibited by STIM1 knock-down.

The contribution of the novel histamine H(4) receptor to histaminergic and allergic pruritus was investigated. Histamine and a selective histamine H(4) receptor agonist caused scratching responses in mice, which were almost completely attenuated in histamine H(4) receptor knockout mice or by pretreatment with the selective histamine H(4) receptor antagonist, JNJ 7777120. Pruritus induced by allergic mechanisms was also potently inhibited with histamine H(4) receptor antagonist treatment or in histamine H(4) receptor knockout mice. In all cases, the inhibitory effect of histamine H(4) receptor antagonist was greater than those observed with histamine H(1) receptor antagonists.

Formyl peptide receptor 1 gene-deficient mice were administered DDS in drinking water for a single 5-day period (acute) or in two 5-day periods separated by 16 days (chronic). At the end of the treatment their colons were excised, measured, and prepared for histological evaluation. FPR1(-/-) mice experienced less severe acute colonic pathology than C57BL/6 (wildtype) mice. The opposite was observed following the second colitis cycle, with FPR1(-/-) mice developing worse pathology than wildtype mice. Both strains had similar numbers of infiltrating neutrophils in ulcerated areas of the colon after a single DSS cycle, but FPR1(-/-) mice had significantly more neutrophils in the ulcerated mucosa after two cycles. There was no difference in the capacity of neutrophils from each strain to migrate to chemoattractants. Since the FPR1(-/-) mice had larger ulcers compared to the wildtype mice, we propose that the FPR1(-/-) mice failed to recover at the same rate as wildtype mice.

NO release was measured directly in cell supernatants using a Sievers NO Analyser, and in vitro angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying capillary-like tube network formation of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) on growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Incubation of PAEC with DTT or vitamin C significantly increased NO release in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, L-NNA and L-NIO, had no effect on DTT- or vitamin C-induced NO release, and there was no concomitant increase in the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS at serine-1177 following DTT or vitamin C treatment. DTT and vitamin C increased capillary-like tube network formation by nine- and two-fold, respectively, and the addition of copper ions doubled the effect of vitamin C.

Increased passive resistance in the triceps surae muscles is common following acquired brain injury. Adaptive shortening secondary to relative immobility, and increased stiffness due to rheologic changes within the musculo-tendinous unit, may be exacerbated by plantarflexor muscle overactivity related to the brain injury itself. Three variables representing resistance to passive lengthening and soleus muscle length were compared between subjects with recent brain injury and age matched normal controls. Comparison between limbs was made for subjects with unilateral neurological impairment. Slow passive dorsiflexion stretches were performed using a computer controlled dynamometer. Muscle stiffness in the initial and latter portion of the range, and the angles achieved at torques of 5 and 10 N m were determined from torque-angle curves. Maximal ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed was considered to reflect soleus muscle length. Significant differences were demonstrated for all variables, except passive stiffness near the end of available range.

To test these assertions, we compared combinations of paclitaxel and gefitinib using either intermittent or continuous dosing schedules in mice. We found that when used in combination with paclitaxel, pulsatile gefitinib was significantly superior to continuous dosing.

        "context": "The study of biological networks and how they have evolved is fundamental to our understanding of the cell. By investigating how proteins of different ages are connected in the protein interaction network, one can infer how that network has expanded in evolution, without the need for explicit reconstruction of ancestral networks. Studies that implement this approach show that proteins are often connected to proteins of a similar age, suggesting a simultaneous emergence of interacting proteins. There are several theories explaining this phenomenon, but despite the importance of gene duplication in genome evolution, none consider protein family dynamics as a contributing factor. In an S. cerevisiae protein interaction network we investigate to what extent edges that arise from duplication events contribute to the observed tendency to interact with proteins of a similar age. We find that part of this tendency is explained by interactions between paralogs. Age is usually defined on the level of protein families, rather than individual proteins, hence paralogs have the same age. The major contribution however, is from interaction partners that are shared between paralogs. These interactions have most likely been conserved after a duplication event. To investigate to what extent a nearly neutral process of network growth can explain these results, we adjust a well-studied network growth model to incorporate protein families. Our model shows that the number of edges between paralogs can be amplified by subsequent duplication events, thus explaining the overrepresentation of interparalog edges in the data. The fact that interaction partners shared by paralogs are often of the same age as the paralogs does not arise naturally from our model and needs further investigation.",

        "context": "2-Methoxystypandrone (2-MS) is a naphthoquinone isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, a Chinese herb used to treat bone diseases. Here we have determined whether 2-MS antagonised osteoclast development and bone resorption. RAW264.7 cells were treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) to induce differentiation into osteoclasts. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyse osteoclast-associated gene expression and signalling pathways. The number of multinuclear osteoclasts, actin rings and resorption pit formation were markedly inhibited by 2-MS, targeting osteoclast differentiation at an early stage and without significant cytotoxicity. The anti-resorption effect of 2-MS was accompanied by decreasing dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA expression. RANKL-increased MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was also attenuated by concurrent, but not by subsequent addition of 2-MS. 2-MS markedly inhibited not only the RANKL-triggered nuclear translocations of NF-kappaB, c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), but also the subsequent NFATc1 induction. Degradation of IkappaB and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases were also suppressed. RANKL facilitated the formation of signaling complexes of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TRAF6-TAK1), important for osteoclastogenesis and formation of such signalling complexes was prevented by 2-MS.",
        "response": "The anti-osteoclastogenic effects of 2-MS could reflect the block of RANKL-induced association of TRAF6-TAK1 complexes with consequent decrease of IkappaB-mediated NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases-mediated c-Fos activation pathways and suppression of NFATc1 and other gene expression, essential for bone resorption.",

        "context": "Increases in energy substrate oxidation occur at different rates after an increase in either fat or carbohydrate intake. Adaptations to increased fat intake are relatively slow and are influenced by activity level. We tested the hypothesis that increased levels of daily activity, as influenced by added exercise, would have a graded effect on the rate of compensatory adjustment to a short-term high-fat diet. Daily total energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation were measured at 3 physical activity levels (PALs) by using a whole-room indirect calorimeter in 10 adult women as they transitioned from a 1-d low-fat (30% of energy) control diet to a 4-d high-fat (50% of energy) diet. The 3 PALs (1.4, 1.6, and 1.8) were provided daily by increases in bicycle ergometer exercise time. An increase in physical activity led to a greater increase in the nonprotein respiratory exchange ratio (-0.047 +/- 0.02, -0.064 +/- 0.02, and -0.071 +/- 0.02; P < 0.0001) and 24-h fat oxidation (113 +/- 24, 125 +/- 19, and 147 +/- 20 g/d; P < 0.0001) for PALs of 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8, respectively, after the transition from the low-fat control diet to the high-fat diet. Random-effects analysis found a significant (P = 0.003) relation between PAL and the compensatory fat oxidation response to a high-fat diet.",
        "response": "Amounts of exercise consistent with the Institute of Medicine's recommendations reduce the time required to match fat oxidation to a change in the percentage of fat in the diet.

Potential efficacy of ImmuBalance™, which is the fermented soy product, on treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) was investigated using a mouse model for human AD, NC/Tnd mice. For in vivo study, ImmuBalance containing chow or a control diet were fed to NC/Tnd mice with moderate dermatitis for 2 weeks. Topical application of FK506 ointment was used as a positive control. Clinical skin severity scores, scratching behaviors, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and histological features were analyzed. For in vitro study, suppressive effect of ImmuBalance™ on nerve growth factor (NGF)-activated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was examined. Clinical skin severity scores of the mice fed with ImmuBalance containing chow were gradually reduced as well as the mice treated with FK506. Feeding with ImmuBalance completely inhibited the increase in scratching behavior of NC/Tnd mice. The value of TEWL of NC/Tnd mice fed with ImmuBalance was significantly decreased. In addition, histological examination revealed that application of ImmuBalance decreased the number of PGP9.5-positive neuronal fibers in the lesional skin. When ImmuBalance extract was added to the culture, NGF-activated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was diminished through the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphorylation.",

        "context": "Control of reproduction and prevention of reproductive health problems are important reasons for women to use health services, but the proper organisational level of service provision is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visits to private gynaecologists correlate with better health outcomes and worse participation in organised screening for cancer programs. This is an ecological analysis using municipalities and groups of women at 5-year age intervals within municipalities as study units. First, the Finnish municipalities (n = 452) were classified into three groups by the age-adjusted level of use of private gynaecologists. Secondly, each age group within municipalities was classified into tertiles by the level of private gynaecologist use. The outcomes were participation in cervical and organised breast cancer screening for cancer programmes, stage of gynaecological and breast cancers at diagnosis, and abortion rates and ratios. All data were obtained from national registers by groups at 5-year age intervals and by municipality. Raw and adjusted (age groups, and in some analyses, municipality social class index) odds ratios, total and by urbanity, were calculated. The proportions of women participating in cervical cancer and organised breast cancer screening for cancer were somewhat higher in the groups having a low use of private gynaecologists. The proportions of local cancers of all cervical, uterine, ovarian and breast cancers were similar in the three groups, even though the first analysis method suggested somewhat better results for the low-use group in case of cervical cancer and for the high-use group in case of uterine and breast cancer. The rates of induced abortion were higher in municipalities having a high use of private gynaecologists than in those having lower use.",
        "response": "This ecological analysis suggests that frequent use of private gynaecologists relates somewhat to lower organised screening for cancer participation, and is not better in preventing abortions or in detecting cancer earlier.

We used data from 332 African-American women 13-19 years old recruited at public family planning and prenatal clinics in New Orleans. Using a series of ANOVAs and multinomial logistic regression, we assessed differences in POEM between four different outcome groups: women who were never pregnant and those who had only intended pregnancies, only unintended pregnancies and both unintended and intended pregnancies. The data suggested that young women perceive pregnancy as an opportunity to assert responsibility, become closer with their families and achieve greater intimacy with their boyfriends. Multiple regression analysis indicated that this positive orientation toward early motherhood independently raised the likelihood that young women experienced unintended pregnancies. In particular, the perception that a pregnancy makes a young woman feel more responsible was associated with an increased likelihood that a young woman had only unintended pregnancies compared to no pregnancies at all. Interestingly, this perception did not differentiate young women who had only intended pregnancies from those who were never pregnant.",
        "response": "When interpreting reports of unintended pregnancy, more attention should be given to young women's orientation toward early motherhood. Doing so will inform policies that address both personal and structural factors that contribute to persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy among adolescents.",

        "context": "Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway occurs in almost all colorectal cancers and contributes to their growth, invasion and survival. Phopholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in progression of colorectal carcinoma However, an understanding of the targets and regulation of this important pathway remains incomplete and besides, relationship between Wnt signaling and PLD is not known. Here, we demonstrate that PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2 are direct targets and positive feedback regulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Wnt3a and Wnt mimetics significantly enhanced the expression of PLDs at a transcriptional level in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, whereas silencing of beta-catenin gene expression or utilization of a dominant negative form of T cell factor-4 (TCF-4) inhibited expression of PLDs. Moreover, both PLD1 and PLD2 were highly induced in colon, liver and stomach tissues of mice after injection of LiCl, a Wnt mimetic. Wnt3a stimulated formation of the beta-catenin/TCF complexes to two functional TCF-4-binding elements within the PLD2 promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppressing PLD using gene silencing or selective inhibitor blocked the ability of beta-catenin to transcriptionally activate PLD and other Wnt target genes by preventing formation of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex, whereas tactics to elevate intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity, enhanced these effects. Here we show that PLD is necessary for Wnt3a-driven invasion and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells.",

        "context": "Patients with malignant glioma suffer global compromise of their cellular immunity, characterized by dramatic reductions in CD4(+) T cell numbers and function. We have previously shown that increased regulatory T cell (T(reg)) fractions in these patients explain T-cell functional deficits. Our murine glioma model recapitulates these findings. Here, we investigate the effects of systemic CTLA-4 blockade in this model. A monoclonal antibody (9H10) to CTLA-4 was employed against well-established glioma. Survival and risks for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis were assessed, as were CD4(+) T cell numbers and function in the peripheral blood, spleen, and cervical lymph nodes. The specific capacities for anti-CTLA-4 to modify the functions of regulatory versus CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells were evaluated. CTLA-4 blockade confers long-term survival in 80% of treated mice, without eliciting experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Changes to the CD4 compartment were reversed, as anti-CTLA-4 reestablishes normal CD4 counts and abrogates increases in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)GITR(+) regulatory T cell fraction observed in tumor-bearing mice. CD4(+) T-cell proliferative capacity is restored and the cervical lymph node antitumor response is enhanced. Treatment benefits are bestowed exclusively on the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell population and not T(regs), as CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells from treated mice show improved proliferative responses and resistance to T(reg)-mediated suppression, whereas T(regs) from the same mice remain anergic and exhibit no restriction of their suppressive capacity.",

Analysis of volume-kinetics has identified an increase in interstitial fluid volume after crystalloid fluid loading during isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane has also been associated with postoperative hypoxemia and may be associated with an increase in alveolar epithelial permeability, edema formation, and hindered oxygen exchange. In this article, the authors compare fluid extravasation rates before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with isoflurane- versus propofol-based anesthesia. Fourteen pigs underwent 2 h of tepid CPB with propofol (P-group; n = 7) or isoflurane anesthesia (I-group; n = 7). Fluid requirements, plasma volume, colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit levels, and total tissue water content were recorded, and fluid extravasation rates calculated. Fluid extravasation rates increased in the I-group from the pre-CPB level of 0.27 (0.13) to 0.92 (0.36) ml·kg·min, but remained essentially unchanged in the P-group with significant between-group differences during CPB (pb = 0.002).

We used dietary intake and biomarker information from the NHANES 2001-2002, MyPyramid Equivalents Database, and Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. The survey package in R software was used to estimate means and CIs, taking into account the strata, primary sampling units, and appropriate survey weight. We implemented 2 different approaches to estimate total iron absorption. In the first approach, we included all survey participants but adjusted the geometric mean of nonheme iron absorption to 15 μg ferritin/L serum to mimic values of individuals with no iron stores; in the second approach, absorption was estimated for only nonanemic subjects with no iron stores. A total sample size of 6631 was used based on availability of dietary and iron status biomarker data and C-reactive protein concentration ≤ 6 mg/L. The geometric mean (95% CI) of unadjusted nonheme iron absorption for all subjects was 3.7% (3.6%, 3.8%), higher in female subjects [5.6% (5.4%, 5.7%)] than male subjects [2.6% (2.5%, 2.7%)] (P < 0.0001).

In the early stage of glomerulosclerosis occur renal mesangial expansion and renal filtration dysfunction. Purple corn has been classified as a functional food and is rich in anthocyanins exerting potential disease-preventive activities. The in vitro study using human renal mesangial cells examined that anthocyanin-rich purple corn butanol fraction (PCB) can attenuate high glucose (HG)-promoted mesangial cell proliferation and matrix accumulation. Cells were cultured for 3 days in media containing 33 mM glucose in the presence of 1-20 μg/mL PCB. In the in vivo animal study, db/db mice were treated with 10 mg/kg anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic extracts of purple corn (PCE) for 8 weeks. HG enhanced mesangial production of the fibrosis biomarkers of collagen IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was markedly attenuated by adding PCB. Such mesangial fibrosis entailed interleukin-8 activation via eliciting Tyk2-STAT signaling pathway. PCB dampened HG-promoted mesangial hyperplasia that appeared to be attributed to increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor. The 8-week administration of PCE lowered plasma glucose level of db/db mice and ameliorated severe albuminuria.

In vitro and in vivo cell models were developed to investigate the biological and molecular functions of GPX7 in OAC. Reconstitution of GPX7 in OAC cell lines, OE33 and FLO-1, significantly suppressed growth as shown by the growth curve, colony formation and EdU proliferation assays. Meanwhile, GPX7-expressing cells displayed significant impairment in G1/S progression and an increase in cell senescence. Concordant with the above functions, Western blot analysis displayed higher levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 with a decrease in phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (RB), indicating its increased tumour suppressor activities. On the contrary, knockdown of GPX7 in HET1A cells (an immortalised normal oesophageal cell line) rendered the cells growth advantage as indicated with a higher EdU rate, lower levels of p73, p27, p21 and p16 and an increase in phosphorylated RB. We confirmed the tumour suppressor function in vivo using GPX7-expressing OE33 cells in a mouse xenograft model.

Seventy-four patients with gastric outlet obstruction underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained from any suspicious looking lesions or from the most distal point at which the endoscope could be positioned. In 56 patients (76%) the cause of the gastric outlet obstruction was malignant. On clinical and endoscopic appearance three patients were wrongly diagnosed as having malignancy when the cause, on endoscopic biopsy, was benign (tuberculosis n = 2, and immunoproliferative small intestinal disease n = 1). Twelve of the 18 patients with benign gastric outlet obstruction were managed conservatively with drugs and endoscopic balloon dilatation.",

We report findings from the California Women's Health Survey (1998-2000), a large, annual statewide health surveillance survey of California women that in 1998 began to include questions assessing same-gender sexual behavior. Overall, homosexually experienced women are more likely than exclusively heterosexually experienced women to currently smoke and to evidence higher levels of alcohol consumption, both in frequency and quantity. Focusing on age cohorts, the greatest sexual orientation disparity in alcohol use patterns appears clustered among women in the 26-35-year-old group. We also find that recently bisexually active women report higher and riskier alcohol use than women who are exclusively heterosexually active.

        "context": "There is a great need to search for natural compounds with superior prebiotic, antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties for use in (food) applications. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) show such properties. Moreover, they contribute to stress tolerance in plants, acting as putative membrane stabilizers, antioxidants and signalling agents. A large-scale soluble carbohydrate screening was performed within the plant kingdom. An unknown compound accumulated to a high extent in early-spring red deadnettle (Lamium purpureum) but not in other RFO plants. The compound was purified and its structure was unravelled with NMR. Organs and organ parts of red deadnettle were carefully dissected and analysed for soluble sugars. Phloem sap content was analysed by a common EDTA-based method. Early-spring red deadnettle stems and roots accumulate high concentrations of the reducing trisaccharide manninotriose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glc), a derivative of the non-reducing RFO stachyose (Galα1,6Galα1,6Glcα1,2βFru). Detailed soluble carbohydrate analyses on dissected stem and leaf sections, together with phloem sap analyses, strongly suggest that stachyose is the main transport compound, but extensive hydrolysis of stachyose to manninotriose seems to occur along the transport path. Based on the specificities of the observed carbohydrate dynamics, the putative physiological roles of manninotriose in red deadnettle are discussed.",
        "response": "It is demonstrated for the first time that manninotriose is a novel and important player in the RFO metabolism of red dead deadnettle. It is proposed that manninotriose represents a temporary storage carbohydrate in early-spring deadnettle, at the same time perhaps functioning as a membrane protector and/or as an antioxidant in the vicinity of membranes, as recently suggested for other RFOs and fructans. This novel finding urges further research on this peculiar carbohydrate on a broader array of RFO accumulators.",

        "context": "Inhibitor of differentiation 4 (Id4), a member of the Id gene family is also a dominant negative regulator of basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Some of the functions of Id4 appear to be unique as compared to its other family members Id1, Id2 and Id3. Loss of Id4 gene expression in many cancers in association with promoter hypermethylation has led to the proposal that Id4 may act as a tumor suppressor. In this study we provide functional evidence that Id4 indeed acts as a tumor suppressor and is part of a cancer associated epigenetic re-programming. Data mining was used to demonstrate Id4 expression in prostate cancer. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis was performed to understand molecular mechanisms associated with Id4 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 cells was determined by cell cycle analysis (3H thymidine incorporation and FACS), expression of androgen receptor, p53 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 by a combination of RT-PCR, real time-PCR, western blot and immuno-cytochemical analysis. Id4 expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer. Id4 expression was also down-regulated in prostate cancer line DU145 due to promoter hyper-methylation. Ectopic Id4 expression in DU145 prostate cancer cell line led to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation due in part by an S-phase arrest. In addition to S-phase arrest, ectopic Id4 expression in PC3 cells also resulted in prolonged G2/M phase. At the molecular level these changes were associated with increased androgen receptor (AR), p21, p27 and p53 expression in DU145 cells.",
        "response": "The results suggest that Id4 acts directly as a tumor suppressor by influencing a hierarchy of cellular processes at multiple levels that leads to a decreased cell proliferation and change in morphology that is possibly mediated through induction of previously silenced tumor suppressors.",

        "context": "Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) via subcutaneous osmotic pumps into mice promotes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). These AngII-induced AAAs develop via a complex process in which there is a transmedial break, lumen dilation, thrombus formation, inflammation involving cells of both the innate and acquired immune systems, and remodeling. The recent development of a high-frequency ultrasound machine has permitted the noninvasive detection of murine abdominal aortas. We assessed the ability of a Visualsonics Vevo 660 high-resolution imaging system to detect AAAs and sequentially quantify the aortic luminal diameter. This system had 100% accuracy in detecting AngII-induced AAAs in vivo, with intrauser and interuser variation coefficients of less than 10% for quantification of the aortic lumen diameter. Male apolipoprotein E (apoE)(-/-) mice were infused subcutaneously with either saline or AngII and were monitored with this ultrasonic system to define the temporal changes in aortic lumen diameter. Aortic luminal diameters were measured in the aneurysm-susceptible region of the suprarenal aorta. For internal controls, abdominal aortic diameters were measured at the level of the left renal branch, because this landmark region did not dilate during AngII infusion. Luminal diameters of the suprarenal aorta did not change significantly in saline-infused mice over 28 days of measurement (P = .71). In contrast, AngII infusion led to rapid dilation of suprarenal aortas during the initial 7 days of infusion (0.071 mm/d; P = .0037 for the change in the initial expansion rate). Further luminal diameter expansions occurred for the remaining 21 days of observation at a more modest rate (0.023 mm/d; P = .0001 for continued expansion after day 7). Within the initial 14 days of AngII infusion, some apoE(-/-) mice died as a result of rupture of the aorta in the suprarenal region. We had previously assumed that aortic dilation and rupture occurred simultaneously. However, in the AngII-infused mice that succumbed to aortic rupture, luminal diameters increased several days before death.",

Mapping of major Cry1A resistance genes has linked resistance to the ABCC2 locus in Heliothis virescens, Plutella xylostella, Trichoplusia ni and Bombyx mori, and mutations in this gene have been found in three of these Bt-resistant strains. We have used a colony of Spodoptera exigua (Xen-R) highly resistant to a Bt commercial bioinsecticide to identify regions in the S. exigua genome containing loci for major resistance genes by using bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Results reveal a region containing three genes from the ABCC family (ABBC1, ABBC2 and ABBC3) and a mutation in one of them (ABBC2) as responsible for the resistance of S. exigua to the Bt commercial product and to its key Spodoptera-active ingredients, Cry1Ca. In contrast to all previously described mutations in ABCC2 genes that directly or indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the ABCC2 mutation found in S. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in ATP binding. Functional analyses of ABBC2 and ABBC3 support the role of both proteins in the mode of action of Bt toxins in S. exigua. Partial silencing of these genes with dsRNA decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. In addition, reduction of ABBC2 and ABBC3 expression negatively affected some fitness components and induced up-regulation of arylphorin and repat5, genes that respond to Bt intoxication and that are found constitutively up-regulated in the Xen-R strain.",

This study aimed to explore potential molecular pathways underlying HG functional mechanism during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, involving lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13. Murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured in osteogenic-inducing medium supplemented with high glucose level at 25mM or 5.5mM as normal control. Expression levels of lncRNA AK028326 and CXCL13 were measured by using real-time PCR. The mineralized nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were detected after 21 and 7days of incubation respectively. Western blot were also performed to determine the expression of CXCL13 and osteogenic gene markers. Plasmid pcDNAs and small interference RNAs were transfected as indicated for functional analysis of AK028326 and CXCL13. HG suppressed the expression of AK028326 and CXCL13 in MSCs in a time-dependent manner, and also the mineralization, ALP activity, and osteogenic gene expression, which could be reversed by overexpression of AK028326 or CXCL13. CXCL13 expression was positively regulated by AK028326 at both mRNA and protein levels.

Clinical guidelines recommend that patients with extensive IM undergo a gastroscopy every 3 years. However, protein biomarkers that indicate a transition from IM to GC are lacking. Our group recently identified an interferon-alpha (IFNα)-responsive gene, Schlafen 4 (Slfn4), in immune cells that correlates with metaplastic changes in Helicobacter-infected mice. We therefore tested the hypothesis that a human homolog of Slfn4, namely, Schlafen 5 (SLFN5), correlates with progression of GCPL to GC. Jurkat T-lymphoid and HL-60 myeloid cell lines were treated with IFNα, and SLFN5 mRNA was quantified by quantitative PCR. SLFN5 protein expression in the inflamed gastric mucosa was co-localized to specific immune cell types by immunohistochemistry using CD20, CD2, and MAC2 antibodies. SLFN5 expression was also determined by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from individuals with non-atrophic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, complete IM, incomplete IM, and GC, respectively. The IFNα treatment of Jurkat and HL-60 cells induced SLFN5 mRNA. SLFN5 protein was expressed mainly by T lymphocytes in inflamed gastric mucosa.

Its pathophysiology and the parameters, which may impact on its duration, remain unclear. The aim of this study was to measure the role of various clinical determinants on restoration of intestinal function after elective colorectal surgery. From July 2002 to September 2003, all patients who underwent laparotomy for colectomy (laparoscopic resections excluded) with either an ileotransverse, colocolic, or high colorectal anastomosis were entered in this prospective study. The intervals in hours between the end of the surgical procedure and passing of flatus (PG) and passing of stool (PS) were recorded by an independent investigator. PG and PS were eventually correlated with the following parameters: type of colectomy, early removal of nasogastric tube (NGT), mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), type of underlying disease, systemic administration of opiates, and surgical training (colorectal fellowship or other). One hundred twenty-four patients were entered in this study. Four patients (3.2%) developed septic complications (3 anastomotic leaks and 1 intraabdominal abscess) and were excluded from the analysis. Median age in this population was 68 (range 30-95) years. Mean duration of postoperative ileus was 70+/-28 h (PG) and 99+/-34 h (PS). The type of colectomy, underlying disease, MBP, and early NGT removal failed, in univariate analysis, to correlate with the duration of postoperative ileus. By contrast, time intervals PG and PS were statistically shorter in the group of patients treated by a colorectal surgeon [56+/-23 vs 74+/-28 h (PG); 82+/-26 vs 103+/-35 h (PS), p=0.004], as well as in patients who received systemic opiates for less than 2 days [64+/-27 vs 75+/-28 h (PG), p=0.04; 88+/-32 vs 108+/-33 h (PS), p=001].",

        "context": "Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) is a ubiquitous enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which catalyzes co-translational removal of N-terminal methionine from elongating polypeptide chains during protein synthesis. It specifically removes the terminal methionine in all organisms, if the penultimate residue is non-bulky and uncharged. The MetAP action for exclusion of N-terminal methionine is mandatory in 50-70% of nascent proteins. Such an activity is required for proper sub cellular localization, additional processing and eventually for the degradation of proteins. We cloned genes encoding two such metalloproteases (MtMetAP1a and MtMetAP1c) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and expressed them as histidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. Although they have different substrate preferences, for Met-Ala-Ser, we found, MtMetAP1c had significantly high enzyme turnover rate as opposed to MtMetAP1a. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies as well as monitoring of enzyme activity indicated high temperature stability (up to 50 °C) of MtMetAP1a compared to that of the MtMetAP1c. Modelling of MtMetAP1a based on MtMetAP1c crystal structure revealed the distinct spatial arrangements of identical active site amino acid residues and their mutations affected the enzymatic activities of both the proteins. Strikingly, we observed that 40 amino acid long N-terminal extension of MtMetAP1c, compared to its other family members, contributes towards the activity and stability of this enzyme, which has never been reported for any methionine aminopeptidase. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that Val-18 and Pro-19 of MtMetAP1c are crucial for its enzymatic activity. Consistent with this observation, molecular dynamic simulation studies of wild-type and these variants strongly suggest their involvement in maintaining active site conformation of MtMetAP1c.",

Many target cells, however, express low levels of Ad5 native receptor, the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), and thus are resistant to Ad5 infection. The Protein Transduction Domain of the HIV Tat protein, namely PTD tat, has been shown to mediate protein transduction in a wide range of cells. We hypothesize that re-targeting Ad5 vector via the PTD tat motif would improve the efficacy of Ad5-mediated gene delivery. In this study, we genetically incorporated the PTD tat motif into the knob domain of Ad5 fiber, and rescued the resultant viral vector, Ad5.PTD tat. Our data showed the modification did not interfere with Ad5 binding to its native receptor CAR, suggesting Ad5 infection via the CAR pathway is retained. In addition, we found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy in all of the cell lines that we have tested, which included both low-CAR and high-CAR decorated cells. Competitive inhibition assays suggested the enhanced infectivity of Ad5.PTD tat was mediated by binding of the positively charged PTD tat peptide to the negatively charged epitopes on the cells' surface. Furthermore, we investigated in vivo gene delivery efficacy of Ad5.PTD tat using subcutaneous tumor models established with U118MG glioma cells, and found that Ad5.PTD tat exhibited enhanced gene transfer efficacy compared to unmodified Ad5 vector as analyzed by a non-invasive fluorescence imaging technique.",

In this experiment, subsecond dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens during delay-discounting sessions before and after cocaine treatment. Blockade of CB1Rs reversed and prevented cocaine-induced impulsivity. Electrochemical results showed that during baseline and following disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, there was a robust increase in dopamine for immediate large rewards compared with immediate small rewards, but this effect reversed when the delay for the large reward was 10 seconds.

Cannabinoid type 1 receptor blockade may thus counteract maladaptive alterations in afferents to dopamine neurons, thereby preventing changes in dopaminergic activity underlying a loss of self-control.",

        "instruction": "Are angiotensin II type 1a receptor signals involved in the progression of heart failure in MLP-deficient mice?",
        "context": "Angiotensin II (AT) is implicated in the development of cardiac remodeling, which leads to heart failure, and pharmacological inhibition of the AT type 1 (AT1) receptor has improved mortality and morbidity in patients of heart failure. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the AT1 receptor in disease progression in muscle LIM protein (MLP)-deficient mice, which are susceptible to heart failure because of defective function of mechanosensors in cardiomyocytes. Hearts from MLP knockout (MLPKO) mice and MLP-AT1a receptor double knockout (DKO) mice were analyzed. MLPKO hearts showed marked chamber dilatation with cardiac fibrosis and reactivation of the fetal gene program. All of these changes were significantly milder in the DKO hearts. Impaired left ventricular (LV) contractility and filling were alleviated in DKO hearts. However, the impaired relaxation and downregulated expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 were unchanged in DKO hearts.",
        "response": "The AT1a receptor is involved in progression of LV remodeling and deterioration of cardiac function in the hearts of MLPKO mice. These results suggest that blockade of the receptor is effective in preventing progression of heart failure in dilated cardiomyopathy.",

        "context": "The consensus about the ideal intravenous fluid in trauma patients remains open. However, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) seems to have advantages in terms of immuno-modulatory and haemodynamic effects. Nevertheless clotting abnormalities are frequently reported in association with the use of HES. We investigated the influence of light, medium and heavy molecular weight (MW) hydroxyethyl starch (HES) on coagulation in 29 healthy subjects. Ringer's lactate (RL) served as a control solution. Thrombelastography using Haemoscope's Thrombelastograph (TEG) hemostasis system was used to assess the effect of HES polymers and RL. TEG analysis was performed using recalcified native whole blood both with and without the addition of platelet activating factor IV (PAF IV) before and immediately after infusion of one of the solutions. Infusion of RL or one of the three HES solutions exerts an anticoagulant effect as demonstrated by a increase in clot formation time (R) and a decrease in maximum amplitude (MA), and the angle. The addition of PAF IV reversed these changes.",
        "response": "This data indicate clear evidence of platelet activity per se or platelet interaction with the plasmatic coagulation system.",

        "instruction": "Does neuronal nitric oxide synthase protect against myocardial infarction-induced ventricular arrhythmia and mortality in mice?",
        "context": "Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is expressed in cardiomyocytes and plays a role in regulating cardiac function and Ca2+ homeostasis. However, the role of nNOS in cardiac electrophysiology after myocardial infarction (MI) is unclear. We hypothesized that nNOS deficiency increases ventricular arrhythmia and mortality after MI. MI was induced in wild-type (WT) or nNOS(-/-) mice by ligation of the left coronary artery. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT mice. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) mice had impaired cardiac function 2 days after MI. Telemetric ECG monitoring showed that compared with WT, nNOS(-/-) mice had significantly more ventricular arrhythmias and were more likely to develop ventricular fibrillation after MI. Treatment with the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil reduced the incidence of arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation in nNOS(-/-) mice after MI. To assess the role of nNOS in Ca2+ handling, patch-clamp and Ca2+ fluorescence techniques were used. Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ currents were higher in nNOS(-/-) compared with WT cardiomyocytes. Additionally, nNOS(-/-) cardiomyocytes exhibited significantly higher systolic and diastolic Ca2+ over a range of pacing frequencies. Treatment with the NO donor S-nitroso N-acetyl-penicillamine decreased Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ current in both nNOS(-/-) and WT cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, S-nitrosylation of Ca2+ handling proteins was significantly decreased in nNOS(-/-) myocardium after MI.",
        "response": "Deficiency in nNOS increases ventricular arrhythmia and mortality after MI in mice. The antiarrhythmic effect of nNOS involves inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel activity and regulation of Ca2+ handling proteins via S-nitrosylation.",

        "context": "In recent years, we have gained better knowledge about the influence of indoor environments on respiratory symptoms and asthma. The purpose of this study was to examine certain exposures in the home environment and the risk of adult-onset asthma. A nested case-referent study of adult-onset asthma was performed in a random population sample (n = 15813), aged 20-50 years. Cases for the study included subjects reporting \"physician-diagnosed\" asthma (n= 174). The referents (n = 870) were randomly selected from the whole population sample. The case-referent sample was investigated with a comprehensive mailed questionnaire about exposures in the home environment, asthma, respiratory symptoms, smoking habits, and atopy. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated while controlling for age, sex, smoking, and atopy. Increased adjusted OR for asthma were associated with exposure to molds (OR 2.2, 95%, CI 1.4-3.5), environmental tobacco smoke (OR 2.4, 95%, CI 1.4-4.1), and the presence of a wood stove (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5).",
