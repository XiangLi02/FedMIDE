        "response": "For the neonatal condition characterized by shallow breathing, generalized hypertonia, and umbilical infection, which is indicative of neonatal tetanus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set a case load threshold to consider the condition as eliminated. This threshold is fewer than 1 case per 1000 live births in every district of a country. Achieving this standard means that neonatal tetanus is no longer considered a public health problem in that particular area.",

        "context": "",
        "response": "The drug you are referring to is Acyclovir. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is excreted primarily in the urine in its unchanged form. Because of its low solubility in urine, patients are advised to maintain good hydration to prevent the crystallization of the drug in the kidneys, which can lead to nephrotoxicity. This characteristic requires careful management of fluid intake to ensure it is safely eliminated from the body.",
