        "context": "",
        "response": "Hi, I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist.",

Leukemias are characterized by very high WBC levels (over 50,000/ cubic mm). However, the WBC count can be lower in case of leukemia. They are called sub-leukemic leukemia. In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count.

The pain on the left side of your abdomen could be due to gastritis caused by the possible intake of any painkillers consumed by you for the headaches, etc. If not, it could be due to any intra-abdominal inflammation for which a physical examination along with blood test like a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and serum lipase would have to be done, specially if you consume alcoholic beverages.

A word of caution on birth control pills: All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% foolproof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would also go for a serum Chat Doctor determination and an ultrasound abdomen to rule this out, and then consider your symptoms of breast pain, nausea and fatigue etc. not to be due to a pregnancy, if these tests were negative.

Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. ",

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

        "response": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care",

Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound.

However, would first want to get a good history on how quickly these symptoms came on and if there's been any let-up.  Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies).  If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case.  Worry and anxiousness can also trigger these sorts of symptoms especially the tingling and floating sensations you mention.

You may need long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

This is a condition where the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, becomes swollen in the chest area. It can cause back pain, leg cramps or spasms, and flushing due to poor blood flow to the lower part of the body. The unusual color or odor to your urine may also be a sign that your kidneys are not functioning properly due to reduced blood flow from the aneurysm.",
